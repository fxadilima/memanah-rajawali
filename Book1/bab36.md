Ouyang Feng mengangkat lengannya sedikit dan lengan Ke Zhen'E mati rasa, ia merasakan tekanan di dadanya. Tombaknya terbang ke atas, membuat lubang di langit-langit dan mendarat di atap kuil itu._ |

Huang Rong berkata dengan tenang, "Aku menghargai pujian Paman Ouyang. Sayangnya Guo Jing mudah dibodohi, sampai-sampai
sekarang ini dia tidak mau hidup di bawah langit yang sama dengan ayahku dan aku. Setelah kau menyelamatkan ayah, kalau 
keponakanmu ini masih hidup, aih! Masih bisakah lamaran yang lalu itu dilanjutkan lagi?"

**DRAFT**

Ouyang Feng’s heart was stirred, “What is she getting at by bringing this matter up?” he
pondered. In the meantime, Huang Rong continued, “Shagu, this good brother is very
nice to you, isn’t he?”

“Yes,” Shagu answered, “He is going to take me home. I don’t want to play on that island
anymore, I want to go home.”

“What are you going to do at home?” Huang Rong asked, “There is a dead man in your
house; there is a ghost there.”

“Ah!” Shagu cried, she was scared, “Ah! There is a ghost in my house, a ghost! I don’t
want to go home.”

“Who killed that man?” Huang Rong asked.

“I saw it, it was this good brother ...” Shagu answered, but before she finished, ‘bing!
bing!’ a couple of metallic sounds were heard, two secret projectiles fell down on the
ground.

Huang Rong laughed, “Xiao Wangye [Young Prince], you don’t want her to talk? Fine.
Just don’t use secret projectiles to hurt her.”

Yang Kang was indignant, “This idiot talked nonsense, with ghost and everything.”

“Shagu,” Huang Rong said, “You can keep talking. This nice Yeye [grandpa] loved to
hear your story.”

“No,” Shagu answered, “Good brother doesn’t want Shagu to talk, Shagu won’t talk.”

“That’s right,” Yang Kang said, “Go lie down and sleep. If you open your mouth for just
one more word, I’ll have the ghost come over and eat you.”

Shagu was very scared, “Oh, Oh,” she said. Then Ke Zhen’E heard some rustling sound.
It was Shagu’s clothes, she lied down and slept.

“Shagu,” Huang Rong said, “If you don’t want to talk to me, I’ll get Yeye to take you back
to the Island.”

“I don’t want to go, I don’t want to go,” Shagu scried.

“Then you’ll have to talk,” Huang Rong said, “This good brother has killed someone in
your house; what kind of man has he killed?” Everybody felt strange on why she sud-
denly wanted to talk about Yang Kang killing a man.

Yang Kang’s heart was thumping loudly, he got his right hand ready; as soon as Shagu
revealed his secret about him killing someone at the Ox Village, even if it would arouse
Ouyang Feng’s suspicion, he would use the ‘Nine Yin White-bone Claw’ to kill Shagu. He
was wondering in his heart at the same time, “When I killed Ouyang Ke, only Mu
Nianci, Cheng Yaojia and Lu Guanying, three people saw it. Did any one of them leak
the secret? Hmm, it is likely that Shagu was also there to witness it, I was not being
careful.”

The temple was quiet and everybody was waiting for Shagu to open her mouth. Ke
Zhen’E could feel the tension, but he did not dare to make a slightest move. After wait-
ing for half a day Shagu still did not say anything, only her light snore was heard; ap-
parently she had fallen asleep.

Yang Kang breathed out a sigh of relief; his palm was sweating cold, “This Shagu poses
a great danger to me,” he thought, “I must think of a way to get rid of her.” He cast his
glance toward Ouyang Feng who was sitting quietly with his eyes closed. The moon illu-
minated the side of his face. He looked indifferent, seemed like he was unconcerned of
everything that was going on around him.

Everybody else thought Huang Rong was just talking nonsense. Shagu was asleep;
looked like the case was closed. They started to lie down or sat leaning against the wall,
trying to get some sleep.

Just when the moon was rising higher they heard Shagu’s startled voice. She jumped up
and shouted, “Don’t hurt me! Ouch, it hurt!”

With shrilling voice Huang Rong cried, “Ghost! Ghost! It’s a ghost without legs! Shagu,
you killed that young mister without legs; he is coming to get you!”

In the quietness of the night Huang Rong’s voice made the hair on everybody’s back
rose up.

“No!” Shagu cried, “It wasn’t me! It was this good brother ...” she had not finished when
suddenly ‘Ah!’ ‘Bang!’ ‘Aiyo!’ were heard simultaneously. Yang Kang abruptly sprang
up, his arms outstretched, his fingers forming a claw heading straight toward Shagu’s
skull, but Huang Rong had used her dog-beating stick to entangle his legs.

The temple was in chaos; Sha Tongtian and the others immediately surrounded Huang
Rong. Huang Rong, however, seemed oblivious to all this, her left index finger pointed
toward the temple’s door; she cried out, “Mister with no legs, come here, Shagu is
here!”

Shagu looked at the temple door. It was dark, so all she could see was blackness, but
she was always scared of ghosts ever since she was little; quickly she pulled Huang
Rong’s sleeve and cried in panic, “Don’t come to take my life, it was this good brother
who killed you with an iron spearhead. I was in the kitchen watching through the door
... ghost with no legs, don’t come looking for me!”

Not in a million years would Ouyang Feng guess that his beloved nephew was killed by
Yang Kang; yet he always thought that Yang Kang was unable to tell lies. Obviously
Shagu could not lie.

Sad and angry he laughed maniacally, casting a sharp glance toward Yang Kang. “Xiao
Wangye, my nephew deserved to die. It’s good that you killed him, it’s good!” he said.
His laughter sent a chill on everybody’s spine; his voice was very mournful, making
ears buzzing like innumerable needles were piercing their eardrums at the same time.
Everybody was trembling, their teeth chattered. There were thousands of white-head
crows on the temple’s pagoda that night; Ouyang Feng’s laughter startled them. ‘Caw!
Caw! Caw!’ they were crying noisily and then they flew away loudly flapping their
wings.

Yang Kang thought he would not live to see another day; both eyes looking left and
right, trying to find a way to escape.

Wanyan Honglie was also secretly frightened. After the crows noise subsided he said,
“This girl is insane, Mister Ouyang, how can you believe what she said? Your honorable
nephew came by Xiao Wangye’s invitation because Xiao Wang [lit. little king – he was
referring to himself] is relying heavily on his assistance. How could Xiao Wangye harm
him without any reason?”

Seemingly without making any effort Ouyang Feng stood up, his body glided over and
with a slight bend on his knees he landed on Shagu’s side. His left hand grabbed
Shagu’s arm. “Why did he kill my nephew? Speak up!” he roared.

Shagu was scared to death. “I didn’t kill him, don’t hurt me! Don’t hurt me!” she cried.
She struggled hard, but Ouyang Feng’s grip was like a pair of steel pliers, how could
Shagu free herself? The more she struggled, the harder his grip became. Shagu was
frightened and cried, “Mama!”
