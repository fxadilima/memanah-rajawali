Ouyang Feng mengangkat lengannya sedikit dan lengan Ke Zhen'E mati rasa, ia merasakan tekanan di dadanya. Tombaknya terbang ke atas, membuat lubang di langit-langit dan mendarat di atap kuil itu._ |

***

Huang Rong berkata dengan tenang, "Aku menghargai pujian Paman Ouyang. Sayangnya Guo Jing mudah dibodohi, sampai-sampai
sekarang ini dia tidak mau hidup di bawah langit yang sama dengan ayahku dan aku. Setelah kau menyelamatkan ayah, kalau 
keponakanmu ini masih hidup, aih! Masih bisakah lamaran yang lalu itu dilanjutkan lagi?"

Hati Ouyang Feng tergerak. "Apa untungnya dia mengungkit masalah ini lagi?" pikirnya. Pada saat itu Huang Rong
melanjutkan, "Shagu, kakak yang baik ini sungguh baik kepadamu ya?"

"Iya," jawab Shagu. "Dia mau membawaku pulang. Aku tidak mau lagi bermain di pulau, aku mau pulang."

"Apa yang ingin kau lakukan di rumah?" tanya Huang Rong. "Ada orang mati di rumahmu, ada hantu di sana."

"Ah!" seru Shagu, ia ketakutan. "Ah! Ada hantu di rumahku, hantu! Aku tidak mau pulang."

"Siapa yang membunuh orang itu?" tanya Huang Rong.

"Aku melihatnya, itu kakak yang baik ini..." jawab Shagu, tetapi sebelum ia selesai, 'tring! tring!' suara benda logam
terdengar, dua batang senjata rahasia jatuh ke lantai kuil.

Huang Rong tertawa. "Xiao Wangye, kau tidak ingin dia bicara ya? Boleh. Tapi jangan pakai senjata rahasia untuk 
mencelakainya."

Yang Kang gusar. "Si Tolol ini ngawur, ngomong soal hantu segala."

"Shagu," kata Huang Rong. "Kau bisa terus ngomong. Yeye yang baik ini suka sekali mendengar ceritamu."

"Tidak," jawab Shagu. "Hao Gege tidak mau Shagu bicara, Shagu tidak mau bicara."

"Betul," kata Yang Kang. "Cepat tidur. Kalau kau buka mulut lagi sepatah kata saja, nanti kusuruh hantu datang 
memakanmu."

Shagu ketakutan. "Oh, oh," katanya. Lalu Ke zhen'E mendengar suara 'srekk, srekk'. Itu suara dari pakaian Shagu,
ia berbaring dan tidur.

"Shagu," kata Huang Rong. "Kalau kau tidak mau bicara denganku, akan kupanggil Yeye untuk membawamu kembali
ke pulau."

"Aku tidak mau pergi, aku tidak mau pergi," jerit Shagu.

"Berarti kau harus bicara," kata Huang Rong. "Kakak yang baik ini membunuh orang di rumahmu. Orang macam apa yang 
dibunuhnya?" Semua orang merasa heran, kenapa tiba-tiba ia ingin bicara tentang Yang Kang membunuh orang.

Jantung Yang Kang berdegub kencang, ia menyiapkan tangan kanannya. Begitu Shagu membongkar rahasianya tentang 
membunuh orang di Desa Niu, meskipun akan membangkitkan kecurigaan Ouyang Feng, ia akan menggunakan Cakar Tengkorak
Putih[^cakar-1] untuk membunuh Shagu. Ia bertanya-tanya dalam hati, "Waktu aku membunuh Ouyang Ke, hanya 
Mu Nianci, Cheng Yaojia dan Lu Guanying — tiga orang ini yang melihatnya. Apa mungkin salah satu dari mereka
membocorkan rahasia itu? Hmm, kelihatannya Shagu juga ada di situ dan melihatnya, aku kurang hati-hati."

Kuil itu hening, semua orang menunggu Shagu membuka mulut. Ke Zhen'E bisa merasakan ketegangan, tetapi ia tidak 
berani beegerak sedikit pun. Setelah menunggu lama Shagu tetap tidak mengatakan apa-apa, hanya suara dengkurnya 
yang terdengar. Tampaknya ia tertidur.

Yang Kang menghembuskan nafas lega. Telapak tangannya berkeringat dingin. "Shagu ini berbahaya bagiku,"
pikirnya. "Aku harus memikirkan cara untuk menyingkirkannya." Ia melirik Ouyang Feng yang sedang duduk diam 
dengan mata terpejam. Cahaya bulan menerangi sisi wajahnya. Ia tampak acuh tak acuh, tampaknya ia tidak berminat 
terhadap segala yang terjadi di sekitarnya.

Semua orang mengira Huang Rong hanya omong kosong. Shagu tertidur. Tampaknya kasus itu sudah tertutup. Mereka 
mulai berbaring atau duduk bersandar di dinding, nberusaha untuk tidur.

Ketika bulan naik lebih tinggi mereka mendengar suara Shagu terkejut. Ia melompat dan berseru, "Jangan sakiti aku!
Aw, itu sakit!"

Dengan suara dibuat-buat Huang Rong menangis, "Hantu! Hantu! Itu hantu tanpa kaki! Shagu, kau membunuh Gongzi 
yang tidak punya kaki, dia datang untuk menangkapmu!"

Di keheningan malam suara Huang Rong membuat bulu roma semua orang meremang.

"Tidak!" jerit Shagu. "Bukan aku! Itu kakak yang baik ini..." ia belum selesa bicara ketika tiba-tiba 'Ah!'
'Buk!' 'Aiyo!' terdengar berturut-turut. Yang Kang mendadak bangkit, lengannya terulur, jari-jarinya membentuk cakar
menuju ke arah  batok kepala Shagu, tetapi Huang Rong menguunakan Tongkat Penggebuk Anjing untuk menjegal kakinya.

Kuil itu kacau. Sha Tongtian dan yang lain segera mengepung Huang Rong. Huang Rong, di lain pihak, tampak seolah 
tidak tahu tentang segal hal itu, telunjuk kirinya menuding ke arah pintu kuil, ia menjerit, "Gongzi yang tidak punya 
kaki, ayo sini, Shagu di sini!"

Shagu melihat ke arah pintu kuil. Saat itu gelap, maka yang bisa dilihatnya hanya kegelapan, tetapi ia selalu 
takut pada hantu sejak masih kecil. Cepat-cepat ia menarik lengan jubah Huang Rong dan menangis panik, "Jangan
ambil nyawaku, itu kakak yang baik yang membunuhmu dengan mata tombak. Aku sedang di dapur melihat melalui pintu...
hantu yang tidak punya kaki, jangan mencariku!"

Dalam mimpi pun Ouyang Feng tidak menduga bahwa keponakannya dibunuh oleh Yang Kang. Dan ia selalu mengira Yang Kang 
tidak bisa berbohong. Sudah jelas Shagu tidak bisa berbohong.

Sedih dan marah, ia tertawa seperti orang gila, melirik tajam ke arah Yang Kang. "Xiao Wangye, keponakanku pantas 
mati. Bagus juga kalau kau membunuhnya, bagus!" katanya. Tawanya mengirim hawa dingin ke tulang belakang semua orang,
suaranya meratap sangat menyayat hati, membuat telinga seolah tertusuk jarum tak terhingga banyaknya. Semua orang 
gemetar, gigi mereka gemeretak. Ada ribuan burung gagak berkepala putih malam itu di atas pagoda. Tawa Ouyang Feng 
mengejutkan mereka semua. Mereka memekik bersahut-sahutan dengan berisik, lalu terbang menjauh dengan mengepakkan sayap
kuat-kuat.

Yang Kang merasa ia tidak akan hidup untuk melihat esok hari, kedua matanya melirik ke kiri-kanan dengan liar,
berusaha mencari jalan untuk melarikan diri.

Wanyan Honglie juga diam-diam ketakutan. Setelah suara berisik burung gagak reda ia berkata, "Perempuan ini gila, 
Ouyang Xiansheng, masa kau percaya apa yang dikatakannya? Keponakanmu yang terhormat datang memenuhi undangan 
Xiao Wangye karena Xiao Wang sangat mengandalkan bantuannya. Bagaimana mungkin Xiao Wangye mencelakainya 
tanpa alasan?"

Seolah tanpa usaha Ouyang Feng bangkit berdiri, tubuhnya bergerak dan membungkuk dengan menekuk lututnya sedikit,
ia mendarat di samping Shagu. Tangan kirinya memegang lengan Shagu. "Kenapa dia membunuh keponakanku? Ayo bicara!"
bentaknya.

Shagu ketakutan setengah mati. "Aku tidak membunuhnya, jangan sakiti aku! Jangan sakiti aku!" jeritnya. Ia meronta
keras, tetapi cekalan Ouyang Feng mirip belenggu baja, mana mungkin Shagi melepaskan diri. Makin keras ia meronta, 
makin erat cekalan itu. Shagu menjerit ngeri, "Ibu!"

Ouyang Feng repeated his question several times; Shagu became so scared from crying
that she did not dare to cry anymore. She only stared at Ouyang Feng’s face with a
blank expression.

“Shagu,” Huang Rong soothingly said, “Don’t be afraid, this nice grandpa is going to
give you a cake.”

Her words reminded Ouyang Feng. He realized that if he used force, Shagu would not
dare to talk; therefore, he groped inside his pocket and produced a dried and already
cold steamed bun and held it out to Shagu’s hand. “That’s right! Here, you can eat this
cake.”

Shagu grabbed the bun, her fear was gone. “Yeye, you grabbed my arm, it hurt, you
must not grab me anymore,” she said.

“Good Shagu, you are an obedient child,” Ouyang Feng warmly said, “Yeye won’t grab
your arm anymore.”

Huang Rong said, “That day the mister without legs was hugging a lady. Tell me, was
she pretty?”

Shagu nodded. “Very pretty. I wonder where she is going.”

Huang Rong asked again, “Do you know who she is? You don’t know, do you?”

Shagu’s face lit, she was so proud of herself; she clapped her hands and said, “I know, I
know! She is this good brother’s wife!”

Hearing this, any doubt left in Ouyang Feng’s heart was gone. He knew his nephew’s
lecherous character; it must be because of Mu Nianci that his nephew met his fate. But,
Ouyang Ke’s martial art was higher than Yang Kang’s; even though his legs were in-
jured, Yang Kang was still not his match; he could not figure out how Yang Kang was
able to kill him? He turned his head toward Yang Kang and said, “My nephew was
oblivious to what’s good and what’s not, he dared to offend the Xiao Wangye’s concu-
bine; he deserved to die ten thousand times.”

“No ... No ...” Yang Kang stammered. “It wasn’t me ...”

“Then who?” Ouyang Feng sternly asked.

Yang Kang was so scared that his knees turned into rubber, cold sweats pouring down
his forehead; his usual shrewdness was gone, he was unable to utter a single word.

Huang Rong sighed, “Uncle Ouyang, you can’t blame the Xiao Wangye of being heart-
less, you can’t blame your nephew flirtatious character either, you have only your su-
perb martial art to blame.”

“How so?” Ouyang Feng was puzzled.

Huang Rong answered, “I don’t know why, but in that house at the Ox Village I heard a
couple, a man and a woman, were talking. I do not understand what they were
discussing.”

Listening to this muddy talk with so many unknown Ouyang Feng was more con-
founded, “What did they say?” he asked.

Huang Rong answered, “I will repeat what they said word for word, I won’t add or sub-
tract a single word; please Uncle hear me out. I did not see their faces, I don’t know
who the man was, I don’t know who the woman was either; what I heard was that man
said, ‘If this fact that I killed Ouyang Ke ever leaks out, won’t that be a disaster?’ That
woman replied, ‘A real man is not afraid to take responsibility of his action. If you are
afraid, you shouldn’t have killed him yesterday. Even though his uncle is very fierce,
we can run away to some far away place, he won’t be able to find us.’”

Listening to Huang Rong, Ouyang Feng said, “That woman was right. What did the man
say?”

While these two were talking, one asked the questions and the other answered, Yang
Kang was getting more and more afraid than ever. The moon cast its light through the
temple’s door, throwing a slanting column of light illuminating the face of the temple’s
idol. Yang Kang slowly moved away from the light, quietly walked toward Huang
Rong’s back. He heard Huang Rong answered Ouyang Feng’s question.

“That man said, ‘Meizi [sister/beloved], I have another thought: his uncle’s martial art is
unparalleled, I wanted to take him as my master, I have had this thought for a while,
but they followed a very strict rule: they only take one disciple per generation. Now
that this man is dead, his uncle might take me as his disciple!”

Huang Rong did not mention anybody’s name, but she had an uncanny ability to imi-
tate Yang Kang’s accent. Yang Kang grew up in the northern area, but Bai Xirou, his
mother, was a native of Lin’an in the south; so Yang Kang’s accent was a mixture be-
tween northerners and southerners. As soon as Huang Rong said these things, every-
body knew it was Yang Kang she was imitating.

Ouyang Feng laughed coldly; he turned his head but did not see Yang Kang.

Suddenly they heard ‘whack!’, then ‘Aiyo!’ Someone was crying in alarm. They saw
Yang Kang standing under the moonlight with blood dripping from his right hand, his
face was deathly pale.

Turned out that when Yang Kang heard Huang Rong was revealing his secret he could
not restrain himself much longer; he leaped ferociously, his claw was aimed toward
Huang Rong’s head. As Huang Rong imitated Yang Kang’s accent, she was fully aware
he would certainly attack her; therefore, she had guarded against this attack from the
start. Her martial art level was higher than Yang Kang’s. As soon as she heard the gust
of wind she leaned her head sideways to elude, so the claw fell on her shoulder.

Yang Kang had launched the ‘Nine Yin White-bone Claw’ with all his might, his five fin-
gers landed on the soft hedgehog armor Huang Rong was wearing. A shot of pain trav-
eled from his fingers to his brain; he almost pass out.

The others were clueless as whether it was Yang Kang who made the sneak attack, or
was it Huang Rong or Ouyang Feng who attacked him. They were all scared of Ouyang
Feng, so nobody dared to say anything.

Wanyan Honglie rushed forward, trying to help. “Kang’er, what happened to you?
Where does it hurt?” he asked. Casually he took out the dagger on his belt and placed it
on Yang Kang’s hand. He realized Ouyang Feng would not have good intention. He was
hoping that in a chaotic battle they, father and son, would be able to save their lives.

Enduring his pain Yang Kang said, “I am all right.” He held out his hand to grab the dag-
ger, but his hand was numb, ‘clank!’ the dagger fell on the floor. Hastily he stooped
down to pick it up, but strangely his arm was stiff; it did not want to follow his com-
mand anymore. He was extremely shocked. He tried to pinch his right arm with his left
fingers, but he did not feel anything. He looked up toward Huang Rong and cried out in
horror, “Poison! Poison! You used poison to harm me!”

Peng Lianhu and the others knew they were going to offend Ouyang Feng, but Wanyan
Honglie was the Great Jin’s prominent Prince; surely this Ouyang Ke affair could be dis-
cussed peacefully later. Seeing Yang Kang’s frightened expression, they immediately
rushed forward to offer words of sympathy and called out to Huang Rong, “Quickly
give the antidote to Xiao Wangye!” but everybody stayed as far as possible from
Ouyang Feng.

Huang Rong was indifferent, “Don’t make a fuss; my soft hedgehog armor does not
have any poison on it. There is somebody here who wants to kill him, I don’t have to lift
a finger to harm him.”

But suddenly Yang Kang shouted, “I ... I ... I can’t move!” His knees buckled, his body
slowly slid down, his mouth was producing a growling noise much like a wild beast.

Huang Rong felt strange and she turned toward Ouyang Feng, but saw that he was car-
rying a puzzled expression as well. She turned back toward Yang Kang, she saw Yang
Kang was strangely happy, a crack of smile appeared on the corners of his mouth.
Under the silvery moonlight he looked inhumanly ghastly. Suddenly a thought came
into her mind, she said, “It was Uncle Ouyang who poisoned you.”

Ouyang Feng was puzzled, “From the look of him, it was indeed my marvelous snake’s
poison. I had wanted him to taste it, this little girl had done it on my behalf. Wonderful!
Wonderful! But those snakes, I am the only one in this world who owns them, where
did the little girl get it from?”

“Where can I get that kind of snakes?” Huang Rong asked, “This is your own poison,
you have unwittingly poison him yourself.”

“You are talking weird,” Ouyang Feng said.

“Uncle Ouyang,” Huang Rong said, “I remember your bet against the Old Urchin. You
took the poison from your snakes and feed it to a shark. As this shark died of the poi-
son, the second shark ate its flesh and died of the same poison. This way the poison was
spreading endlessly. Isn’t that so?”

Ouyang Feng laughed, “If my poison is not extraordinary, won’t my title ‘Western
Poison’ be in vain?”

“That’s right,” Huang Rong said, “Nan Xiren was the first shark.”

By that time Yang Kang was already rolling around on the ground like a madman.
Liang Ziweng wanted to comfort him, but how could he stop him?

Ouyang Feng ignored everything, he knitted his eyebrows trying to understand what
Huang Rong was saying, but it was still dark to him. “Please elaborate,” he said.

“Hmm, you used your viper to bite Nan Xiren. That day I came across him on the Peach
Blossom Island and he hit me. His fist landed on my left shoulder. The sharp needles of
my soft hedgehog armor punctured his hand, so his poisonous blood was transferred to
my soft hedgehog armor, which became the second shark. When Xiao Wangye attacked
me, heaven’s net tightened, his claw grabbed my shoulder. Nan Xiren’s poisoned blood
was transferred once again to him. Hey, hey, he is the third shark.”

Hearing Huang Rong’s explanation everybody realized how deathly Ouyang Feng’s poi-
son was. They also remembered Yang Kang’s treacherous plan in killing the Five
Freaks; in the end it was Nan Xiren’s blood which kill him. It was truly a revenge well-
deserved. A chill crept into everybody’s back.

Wanyan Honglie walked toward Ouyang Feng, knelt in front of him and asked, “Mr.
Ouyang, please help save my son’s life; Xiao Wang will always remember your
benevolence.”

Ouyang Feng laughed sinisterly, “Your son’s life is a life indeed, my nephew’s life was
not a life!” His gaze swept through Peng Lianhu and the others’ faces and coldly said,
“Which hero does not agree with me, please speak up!” Everybody recoiled simultane-
ously. Who would dare to open his mouth?

Yang Kang suddenly leaped up, ‘bang!’ he hit Liang Ziweng, sending him somersaulted
in the air and passed out. Wanyan Honglie stood up, calling, “Quick! Take Xiao Wangye
back to Lin’an; we’ll find a good doctor to cure his injury.”

Ouyang Feng laughed, “Who in this world can neutralize The Old Poison’s venom?
Which doctor won’t want to live and dare to mess up my handiwork?”

Wanyan Honglie ignored him, he shouted toward his martial artists, “What are you
waiting for? Quickly take Xiao Wangye away.”

Suddenly Yang Kang jumped high until his head almost hit the beam. He pointed his
finger at Wanyan Honglie and he shouted, “You are not my father! You killed my
mother, now you kill me!”

Wanyan Honglie stepped back and stumbled down. Sha Tongtian said, “Xiao Wangye,
please calm down.” He stepped forward to grab Yang Kang’s arms. Unexpectedly Yang
Kang flipped his hand to push away Sha Tongtian’s hand and quickly seized his arm.
Yang Kang’s left hand formed a claw scratching Sha Tongtian’s arm.

Sha Tongtian cried in pain, hastily he rolled backward to escape, but a moment later he
felt itchiness on his arm. He was terror-stricken!

“This is the fourth shark,” Huang Rong coldly said.

Peng Lianhu and Sha Tongtian were good friends, moreover, Peng Lianhu was also an
expert poison user, he knew Sha Tongtian was poisoned and his life was in grave dan-
ger. In this critical moment almost without thinking he took the saber from his waist
and swiftly chopped Sha Tongtian’s arm halfway down.

Hou Tonghai did not understand Peng Lianhu’s good intention, “Peng Lianhu, you dare
to hurt my ‘Shige’? [Elder martial brother]” He charged Peng Lianhu disregarding his
own safety.

Sha Tongtian endured the pain and shouted, “Idiot, back-off! Brother Peng was saving
my life!”

By this time Yang Kang’s mind was cloudy, he was charging to the east and striking to
the west, kicking and biting randomly. Everybody saw what happened to Sha Tongtian,
nobody dared to come close to him; shouting and yelling they darted out of the temple.

It was a very chaotic situation; the crows on the pagoda were startled, they flew around
in confusion under the moonlight around the temple’s courtyard. Their noisy cries in-
termingled with Yang Kang’s neighing voice.

As Wanyan Honglie was heading toward the temple door he turned his head one more
time and called out, “Kang’er! Kang’er!”

Yang Kang’s eyes were brimming with tears; he also called out, “Fu Wang! Fu Wang!
[Father King]” He walked toward Wanyan Honglie.

Wanyan Honglie was delighted, he spread out his arms and hugged Yang Kang tightly,
“Child, are you feeling better?”

Under the moonlight Yang Kang’s face suddenly changed; he opened his mouth, reveal-
ing two rows of white teeth, ready to bite. Wanyan Honglie was shocked. His left hand
pushed out, breaking the hug. Yang Kang’s strength was completely gone; he fell back-
wards. He struggled hard to crawl back up to no avail.

Wanyan Honglie did not dare to linger much longer, without looking back he hurriedly
went out the temple, mounted his horse and ran as fast as he could. The others were
close on his heels, and in a short moment the temple was quiet again.

Ouyang Feng and Huang Rong saw Yang Kang was rolling around on the ground, each
with his/her own thought, nobody said anything. A moment later Yang Kang’s body
curled up and then ceased to move altogether.

“Enough commotion for half a night,” Ouyang Feng coldly said, “It’s almost daybreak;
let us go looking for your father.”

“Right now my father is on the Peach Blossom Island,” Huang Rong said, “Why do you
want to look for him?”

Ouyang Feng was taken aback, “So the little girl was lying all along,” he sneered.

“The first few sentences were indeed to swindle you,” Huang Rong admitted, “What
kind of man do you think my father is? How could he let himself surrounded by a
bunch of stinky Quanzhen priests? If I did not mention the Nine Yin Manual you
wouldn’t let me interrogate Shagu.”

By this time Ke Zhen’E had totally admired Huang Rong, but he was sad and full of re-
gret at the same time. He only hoped she would find a clever trick to escape soon. He
heard Ouyang Feng said, “There were three parts truth in your lies, otherwise, the Old
Poison wouldn’t be so easily deceived. All right then, recite your father’s translation to
me from the beginning to the end, don’t skip even half a word.”

“What if I don’t remember?” Huang Rong asked.

“It will be best if you remember, otherwise the beautiful face of a smart little girl would
be bitten by my snakes, now that won’t be fun, will it?” Ouyang Feng threatened.

When Huang Rong jumped out from behind the idol she was ready to die; but seeing
Yang Kang’s pitiful death she could not help but feeling frightened. She thought, “Even
if I give him Reverend Yideng’s translation he still won’t let me go. Is it so difficult to es-
cape from his grip?”

She paced back and forth for a while but still could not think of a good way to escape,
so she decided to buy some time and think again later. “If I read the original text I
might remember the interpretation. Why don’t you recite it to me, let me try explaining
it to you,” she said.

“Who could memorize these mumbo jumbo sentences?” Ouyang Feng said, “You don’t
have to confuse me.”

As she heard Ouyang Feng was not able to recite it from memory Huang Rong got a
sudden inspiration. After contemplating it back and forth she came to a conclusion, “He
can’t memorize it, so he must treat the manual as precious as his life.” She quickly said,
“All right then, take out the manual and read it to me.”

Ouyang Feng was determined to hear the explanation; immediately he took an oil-cloth
package from his pocket, after opening three layers of cloth he produced Guo Jing’s al-
tered manual from it. Huang Rong was amused, “Jing Gege wrote a whole bunch of
nonsense, yet the Old Poison treats it as the most precious object.”

Ouyang Feng lighted a fire and found a half-burned candle from the worship table,
with which light he started to read the manual, “Hu bu er, ken xing duo de, si gen liu
bu.”

“That means ‘differentiate it well then divide it into twelve air passages’,” Huang Rong
said.

Ouyang Feng was delighted, “Ji er wen hua si, ha hu,” he read again.

“Capable of healing various illness, gradually entering divine perfection,” Huang Rong
said.

Ouyang Feng read, “Qu da bie si tu, en ni qu.”

Huang Rong hesitated for a moment, shaking her head she said, “Not right, you did not
read correctly.”

“No, I read it correctly,” Ouyang Feng said, “That is what was written.”

“That’s strange,” Huang Rong said, “How come it’s so muddled?” Her left hand on her
head, she pretended to be thinking hard.

Ouyang Feng was anxious. He stared at her, hoping she would find the answer quickly.
A moment later Huang Rong exclaimed, “Ah, I know! It must be that dumb kid Guo Jing
writing it wrong. Let me see.”

Ouyang Feng was not afraid Huang Rong would steal it from him, he handed the man-
ual over. Huang Rong held out her right hand to take the manual, while her left hand
took the candlestick, pretending to examine the manual closely. Suddenly her feet
kicked the ground; she leaped backward for more than a ‘zhang’ [10 feet/3 meter]. She
held the manual within half a ‘chi’ [approximately half a foot] to the candle and
shouted, “Uncle Ouyang, this manual is fake, I’d better burn it down.”

Ouyang Feng was shocked, hastily said, “Hey, hey, what are you doing? Quickly give
that back to me.”

Huang Rong smiled, “Do you want the manual, or my life?”

“What do I want your life for? Quickly give that back to me,” Ouyang Feng said. His
voice was urgent, unusually anxious. His body leaned forward as if ready to strike
anytime.

Huang Rong held the manual two more inches closer to the candle. “Stop! I am going to
burn this manual as soon as you move one more step, then you’ll regret it for the rest of
your life.”

Ouyang Feng silently agreed with what she said. “Humph, you win,” he said, “Put that
manual down and go before I change my mind!”

“You are a grand master of your school, you must not go back on your own words,”
Huang Rong said.

Ouyang Feng calmly said, “I said just put the manual down and you can go.”

Huang Rong knew that he was a proud man; although he was evil and cruel he had
never broken his promise to anybody, so she put the manual along with the candle on
the ground and smiled, “Uncle Ouyang, please excuse me.” Carrying her dog-beating
stick she turned around and walked away.

Contrary to what she was expecting, Ouyang Feng did not even look at her. He jumped
back and with a loud ‘bang!’ he smashed the Wang Yanzhang idol with the back of his
hand, the idol broke halfway down. “Blind man Ke, roll out!” he shouted.

Huang Rong was startled; she turned her head only to see Ke Zhen’E had jumped out
from behind the idol, brandishing his iron spear in front of his body. Huang Rong im-
mediately realized her misjudgment, “With the Old Poison’s ability how could he not
know Master Ke was hiding behind the idol? He must’ve heard his breathing early on,
only he waited patiently for a good opportunity to expose him.” She dashed forward
quickly, standing in front of Ke Zhen’E with the bamboo stick in front of her body.

“Uncle Ouyang, I am not going, you let him go,” said Huang Rong.

“No, Rong’er, you go” Ke Zhen’E said, “Go find Jing’er, tell him to avenge our six lives.”

Huang Rong mournfully answered, “If he is ever going to believe what I say, he would
have already believed what I said. Master Ke, if you don’t go, my father and I will have
a hard time proving our innocence. Tell Guo Jing that I don’t blame him, tell him not to
feel bad.” But how could Ke Zhen’E let her embrace danger to save his own life? Two
people were bickering incessantly.

Ouyang Feng became impatient, “Little girl, I let you go, you don’t want to go. What are
you waiting for?”

“I’d love to stay,” Huang Rong said, “Uncle Ouyang, get this blind man out of here, I will
accompany you chit-chatting, just don’t hurt him.”

Ouyang Feng thought, “You want to stay, that was what I want. Whether this blind man
lives or dies, what does it have anything to do with me?” With big strides he went for-
ward, holding out his hand to grab Ke Zhen’E on his chest.

Ke Zhen’E moved his spear to attack the incoming hand. Ouyang Feng raised his arm a
little bit and Ke Zhen’E’s arms were numb, he felt pressure on his chest. ‘Clank!’ his
spear flew upward, made a hole on the ceiling and landed on the temple’s roof.

Ke Zhen’E hastily leaped backward, but before his feet landed on the floor he felt his
collar was pulled, his body was hung in front of Ouyang Feng. His battle experience
was vast; in this dangerous moment he did not get nervous. His left hand moved
slightly and two ‘du ling’ [poisonous water chestnut] flew toward the enemy’s face.

Ouyang Feng did not anticipate that in the face of danger Ke Zhen’E was still able to at-
tack. They were very close to each other, the incoming attack was strong, it was diffi-
cult to parry; Ouyang Feng bent his body backward but his hand did not let Ke Zhen’E
go, Ke Zhen’E was thrown across the top of his head.

When he jumped out from behind the idol Ke Zhen’E was facing the temple’s door, so
Ouyang Feng’s throw made him fly out of the door. Because Ouyang Feng’s force was so
strong, Ke Zhen’E’s body was actually flying faster than his own ‘du ling’. The ‘du ling’
missed Ouyang Feng’s head and flew straight toward Ke Zhen’E’s body.

“Aiyo!” Huang Rong cried out. But she saw that while he was airborne Ke Zhen’E was
able to turn his body slightly, stretched out his right hand and deftly caught his own
two ‘du ling’s. His ability to hear and differentiate secret-projectiles wind had been
trained to near perfection; his ears could hear as clearly as other people could see.

“You are good!” Ouyang Feng exclaimed, “Blind man Ke, I’ll let you go.”

Ke Zhen’E landed on his feet, he was reluctant to go. Huang Rong laughed, “Master Ke,
Ouyang Feng wanted to be my disciple; he wants to learn the Nine Yin Manual from
me. You still want to stay; do you also want to be my disciple?”

Ke Zhen’E knew that although Huang Rong talked jokingly, but her situation was ex-
tremely precarious. He stood on the temple courtyard, but was hesitant to go.

Ouyang Feng looked up to the sky and said, “It’s daybreak. Let’s go!” Pulling Huang
Rong’s hand they walked out the temple’s door.

“Master Ke, remember the letter I wrote on your palm,” Huang Rong called out. They
moved really fast, Huang Rong’s last few words were heard from several ‘zhang’s away.

Ke Zhen’E stayed motionless for a long time. He heard flock upon flock of crows that
came into the temple to feast on the corpse, so he leaped onto the roof to find his spear
pole. Leaning against his pole on the roof again he stayed motionless for a while, think-
ing the heaven and earth are boundless, but what kind of place could a blind man like
him call home? Then he heard the crows cried mournfully and they dropped to the
ground one by one. Turned out those crows were feasting on Yang Kang’s corpse and
they were poisoned one after another. Ke Zhen’E could not help but heaving a long
sighed. He jumped back down to the ground, wielding his spear he walked to the north.

On the third day suddenly he heard eagle cry high up in the sky. He thought that if the
birds were close by, then Guo Jing must not be very far; therefore, he raised his voice
and shouted in the middle of the wilderness, “Jing’er, Jing’er!”

Not too long afterwards he heard hoof beats; it was indeed Guo Jing riding the little red
horse coming toward him. He was separated from Ke Zhen’E in the chaotic battle the
other night; this time he saw his master was well his joy was unspeakable. He did not
even wait for the horse to stop; he jumped from the horseback and rushed to embrace
his master, calling loudly, “Da Shifu!”

Unexpectedly Ke Zhen’E slapped him left and right until his ears were red. Guo Jing
was stunned, but did not dare to fend off. He let his master off his embrace. Ke Zhen’E
continued to slap Guo Jing with his left hand, while his right hand slapped his own face
until his own ears were red.

Guo Jing was confounded, “Da Shifu, what happened to you?”

Ke Zhen’E viciously scolded, “You are the little muddle-head; I am the old muddle-
head.”

Dozens or so slaps later he calmed down and stopped. Both men’s faces were red and
swollen. Ke Zhen’E kept cursing Guo Jing and himself for half a day before finally he
narrated everything that had happened in the temple.

Guo Jing was surprised yet happy, sorrowful yet ashamed, “So that’s what actually hap-
pened. I had wrongly accused Rong’er,” he thought.

“Tell me, don’t we deserve to die?” Ke Zhen’E shouted. Guo Jing agreed, he also said,
“Disciple deserves to die; Da Shifu’s eyes are not perfect, you cannot be blamed.”

Ke Zhen’E was angry, “Damn it! My eyes are blind, is my heart also blind?”

Guo Jing tried to divert his attention, “We must quickly think of something to rescue
Rong’er.”

“What about her father?” Ke Zhen’E asked.

“Huang Daozhu [Island Master Huang] had taken Hong Enshi [Benevolent Master
Hong] to recuperate on the Peach Blossom Island,” Guo Jing answered, “Da Shifu,
where do you think Ouyang Feng is taking Rong’er?”

Ke Zhen’E pondered for a moment, then said, “Rong’er is in his hands, even if she did
not die, I don’t know what kind of tortures she would be subjected to. Jing’er, you
quickly rescue her, I am going to kill myself to thank her.”

“No!” Guo Jing cried out in alarm, “Don’t even think of doing such thing.” However, he
knew his first master’s stubbornness very well, he would not listen to other people;
once he said he would die, he was not going to back off; therefore, Guo Jing quickly
said, “Da Shifu, you’d better go to the Peach Blossom Island to ask Huang Daozhu to
lend us a hand. In all honesty, I am not Ouyang Feng’s match.”

Ke Zhen’E thought it was not a bad idea, so he picked his spear and left. Guo Jing was
reluctant to part with his first master, he followed him behind. Ke Zhen’E knew he was
being followed, he swung his spear backward and scolded, “You are still not going? If
you don’t rescue my beloved Rong’er, I am going to take your little life!”

Guo Jing had no choice but stopped, his gaze followed his master until he disappeared
beyond the mulberry grove toward the east. He had no idea where to start looking for
Huang Rong. After thinking hard for quite a while he took his horse and pair of eagles
and walked back to the Temple of the Iron Spear.

Around the temple he saw countless dead crows; on the courtyard he saw a pile of hu-
man remains. Guo Jing hated Yang Kang for killing his masters, but thought that Yang
Kang was already dead, so he was willing to write-off that debt; moreover, he was his
sworn brother. Guo Jing picked the remains and buried Yang Kang on the temple’s
courtyard. He bowed in respect in front of the grave and said, “Brother Yang, if you
know how I buried your remains today, you have to bless me in finding Rong’er; that
way you can make up for your crimes during your lifetime.” Afterward Guo Jing started
to make inquiries everywhere, trying to track Huang Rong’s trail.

Half a year had passed, autumn turned into winter, then winter turned into spring. Guo
Jing, accompanied by his red horse and a pair of eagles have looked everywhere; he
asked the Beggar Clan, went to the Quanzhen Sect, and inquired all Wulin characters
he knew, yet nobody heard even a little bit of news about Huang Rong. He was miser-
able. He imagined how much suffering Huang Rong had to endure this past half a year;
it was like a knife was piercing his heart. He was determined to find her, even to the
end of the earth.

He had been to Yanjing, twice he had tried to find Wanyan Honglie at Bianliang, yet
Wanyan Honglie also disappeared without a trace. The Beggar Clan members all over
the country had tried to find their Bangzhu [Clan Leader], but still there were no words

about Huang Rong. Guo Jing also stopped by the Cloud Village, but the village was
burned to the ground. He did not know what kind of disaster Lu Chengfeng and Lu
Guanying had encountered.

One day he arrived within the Shandong border. Nine out of ten houses he saw along
the way were deserted; he barely saw other people walking around. He heard that the
Mongolians and the Jins were fighting each other in that area. The Jins were defeated
and while retreating they stopped at nothing; raping and plundering the people along
their way.

Guo Jing walked for three more days heading north. The further he went, the more dev-
astation he witnessed. His heart was embittered looking at the suffering of the common
people as the result of war.

That day he arrived at a small village by a river bank in a valley; he was going to stop
by for food and water for him as well as his horse, when suddenly he heard a commo-
tion just ahead of him. People were screaming and horses were neighing in panic;
dozens of Jin soldiers had entered the village. They set the village on fire, forcing the
people to go out of their houses. If there was a young girl in the house, the soldiers
would seize her and bind her with ropes. The rest of the people, young and old alike,
were killed right there and then.

Guo Jing was seething with anger; he charged his horse toward the leader of this pack,
snatching his spear; the back of Guo Jing’s left hand smacked his ‘tai yang’ [sun] acu-
point. By that time Guo Jing had already reached high level in term of martial art skill;
his strength was profound. With just one hit that officer’s eyes came out of their sockets
and he died instantly.

The rest of the soldiers were shouting and yelling; sabers and spears attacked simulta-
neously. The little red horse was not afraid of battle; it dashed forward carrying Guo
Jing on its back. Guo Jing snatched a saber with his left hand, and using the mutual
hands combat technique he thrust the spear in his right hand and hacked the saber in
his left, attacking the soldiers left and right.

As soon as the Jin soldiers saw this person’s fierceness, they lost their will to fight; they
turned around and fled from the village. But suddenly a big banner appeared amidst
the smoke; a squad of Mongolian soldiers had arrived. The Jin soldiers who had been
defeated earlier did not dare to fight the Mongolian troops head-on so they turned back
to the village, hoping they would be able to slip by Guo Jing relying on sheer numbers.

Guo Jing hated the Jin soldiers for cruelly abusing the people; he charged his horse to-
ward the village entrance and single-handedly defending it against the intruders. About
a dozen or so soldiers courageously attacked him; Guo Jing killed them all. The rest of
the soldiers did not dare to attack but they could not go back either; they ran around in
confusion, screaming in fear.

The Mongolian soldiers saw ahead of them somebody was helping them; they charged
the rest of the Jin soldiers and killed them all. The ‘bai fu zhang’ [leader of a 100 men
unit] was about to inquire Guo Jing’s background when suddenly one the Mongolian
solider recognized him. That soldier shouted, “Jin dao fu ma! [the golden-blade con-
sort]” and immediately kneeled on the ground.

The ‘bai fu zhang’ heard Guo Jing was their Great Khan’s son-in-law, he did not dare to
be impolite; hastily he dismounted his horse and also kneeled on the ground while dis-
patching a courier to quickly inform their commander-in-chief.

The villagers, young and old, were coming out of their hiding places to thank Guo Jing
when suddenly from outside the village came a loud thundering noise of cavalry’s hoof
beats. The people were frightened; they looked at each other in blank dismay.

A bay horse with a black mane came fast, a young general shouted, “Where is Guo Jing
Anda [Mongolian term for sworn brother]?”

Guo Jing saw it was Tuolei, he was delighted. “Tuolei Anda,” he answered. They rushed
forward and hugged each other. The pair of eagles recognized Tuolei, they flew down
and lovingly rubbed their necks to him.

Tuolei ordered a ‘qian fu zhang’ [leader of a 1000-men unit] to pursue the Jin soldiers,
while the rest of his troops pitched their tents right there on the hillside; then he told
Guo Jing everything that had happened since the last time they parted.

Tuolei told the war affair of the northern countries; only then did Guo Jing find out that
within the last few years Genghis Khan attacked to the east and sent expedition to the
west, expanded his territory. Jochi, Chagatai, Ogedei and Tuolei, four princes; plus
Mukhali, Borchu, Boroul and Chilaun, the Great Khan’s four heroes, his right-hand
men, all had established many distinguished services.

Presently Tuolei and Mukhali were leading their troops to attack the Jin toward the
east; they had fought several battles and utterly routed Jin’s army. The Jins ran to the
fortified city of Tongguan; did not dare to come out to Shandong to fight.

Guo Jing stayed with Tuolei’s troops for several days. A fast dispatch came one day;
Genghis Khan ordered all princes and generals to go back north for a general assembly.
Tuolei and Mukhali did not dare to linger much longer, they assigned their second-in-
commands to lead the troops and that very same night they rode north. Guo Jing
missed his mother, so he came along with Tuolei to the north.

In less than a day they had arrived at the bank of River Onon. As far as eyes could see,
the vast prairies were full of tents, tens of thousands of warhorses running around and
neighing, tens of thousands spearheads gleaming brilliantly under the bright sun light.
In the middle of countless gray tents towered a big yellow silk tent. The tent ornaments
were made of cast gold; above it fluttered nine big banners.

Guo Jing’s horse stood on the river bank as he watched this awe-inspiring military
prowess. He thought about how the great power in this Golden Tent had shaken the
desert, wiping out the other rulers of the area. He imagined how Genghis Khan would
issue his commands from the Golden Tent; then fast horses would be dispatched to de-
liver the orders to the tens of thousands soldiers under the princes and the generals.
The bugles would sound and the beacons on the prairie would be lighted, their fires
reaching the sky. Arrows would fill the sky like a swarm of locusts, spears and blades
would flash, horses and infantrymen would march amidst the dust rising to the sky.

Guo Jing thought, “The Great Khan wants to amass this much land, I wonder what he
wants to do with it?” Suddenly he saw the dust rise and a group of cavalry came to wel-
come them. Three people, Tuolei, Mukhali and Guo Jing entered the Golden Tent to see
the Great Khan. To his surprise he saw all the princes and the generals were already sit-
ting on either side of the tent.

Genghis Khan was overjoyed to see these three people. Tuolei and Mukhali immedi-
ately reported the military situation. Guo Jing stepped forward and kneeled, saying,
“The Great Khan has assigned me to sever the Jin prince, Wanyan Honglie’s head. I met
him several times, yet every time he was able to escape. I am ready to accept The Great
Khan’s punishment.”

Genghis Khan laughed, he said, “When the young eagle grows up, there will come a day
when it will catch the fox. Why would I want to punish you? You arrived just in time; I
often thought about you.”

The assembly then proceeded by discussing military plans to destroy the Jins. Mukhali
proposed that since the Jins occupied the fortified city of Tongguan, it would be difficult
to attack; the best plan would be forming an alliance with the Southern Song and exe-
cute a converging attack.

“Good! Let us do it then,” Genghis Khan said. Immediately he assigned his secretary to
write the letter and sent an envoy to go south. The general assembly convened until
dusk that day.

Guo Jing left the Golden Tent, under the darkened sky he walked to his mother’s tent.
Suddenly a pair of hands appeared from behind, about to cover his eyes. With his cur-
rent martial art skill how could he let anybody launched a sneak attack? He leaned
sideways and was going to push that person away when suddenly his nostrils caught a
whiff of perfume, then he saw it was a girl. Quickly he pulled back his hand and called
out, “Sister Huazheng!” It was indeed Princess Huazheng standing in the dark with
smile all over her face.

They have not seen each other for several years. This time they met again, Guo Jing saw
she was growing taller. She just stood there among the tall grass, her skin jade-white;
she looked beautiful yet valiant. Guo Jing called again, “’Meizi! [Younger Sister, used in
a more intimate way]”

Huazheng was extremely happy that tears flowed down her cheeks, “You really came
back!”

Guo Jing was touched by the sincere expression of her feeling. Thousands of words
were dancing around his mind, but he did not know where to start.

After a few minutes of silence Huazheng said, “Go see your mother. You came back
alive, guess who will be happier, your mother or I?”

“My mother will be very happy, I am sure,” Guo Jing said.

Huazheng pouted, “Do you think I am not happy?”

The Mongolians were more frank, they would say what they think. Guo Jing had lived
among the southerners for quite some time; unconsciously he had been influenced by
the way the southerners talked. Now he went back to his childhood home and heard
Huazheng talked in a friendly manner, a warm feeling filled his heart. Two people
walked hand in hand toward Li Ping’s tent. Mother and son met and there were more
tears of happiness.

Several days later Genghis Khan summoned Guo Jing, “I have heard your conducts and
deeds from Tuolei. You keep your words and have an upright heart, I like that very
much. Just wait several more days, I am going to give you my daughter’s hand in
marriage.”

Guo Jing was startled, he thought, “Right now I don’t even know if Rong’er is dead or
alive. How can I marry someone else?” Seeing Genghis Khan’s imposing appearance, al-
though he wanted to disobey, he stammered and nothing intelligible came out of his
mouth. Genghis Khan misunderstood his behavior; he thought Guo Jing was ecstatic
that he turned silly. Immediately Genghis Khan prepared a dowry for Guo Jing: one
thousand maidservants, one hundred catties of gold, five hundred cows, two thousand
sheep, plus he was told to prepare his own wedding and take anything he needed from
Khan’s treasury.

Huazheng was Genghis Khan’s only daughter from his first wife; she was her father’s
beloved since she was very little. By that time Genghis Khan’s power had already
spread throughout the Mongolian desert, he had subdued many other Khans; who,
upon hearing their Great Khan was going to give his daughter’s hand in marriage, im-
mediately sent precious gifts in abundance. Not too long afterwards, more than a dozen
big tents were needed to store all the gifts.

Princess Huazheng was so happy that she could not erase the smile from her face; Guo
Jing, on the other hand, looked so haggard, his mind was filled with anxiety. He was of-
ten caught looking blankly to a far away place with a dejected look on his face.

Li Ping noticed her son’s countenance was unusual, one evening she asked Guo Jing
point blankly inside their tent. Guo Jing recounted everything about Huang Rong, from
the day they met until they parted a few months ago. Li Ping listened attentively; she
was silent for half a day.

“Ma [Mother],” Guo Jing asked, “Your son is in a difficult situation, I don’t know how to
manage this.”

“Great Khan has shown profound kindness to us, how can we forget it?” Li Ping an-
swered, “But that Rong’er, that Rong’er, ay! Even though I have never met her, I believe
she is an adorable girl.”

“Ma,” Guo Jing suddenly said, “If Father were in this situation, how would he act?”

This question was unexpected to Li Ping; she was silent for half a day; remembering
her late husband’s personality; and then with conviction in her voice said, “Your father
would rather suffer a hardship than offending other people.”

Guo Jing stood up, with a quivering voice he said, “Even though this son of yours has
never seen his father, I should follow my father’s footsteps. If Rong’er is safe, your son
will honor my promise to marry Princess Huazheng; but if Rong’er faced calamity, your
son will not marry for as long as I live.”

Li Ping thought, “That is a proper thing to do, but how can I let you be the last descen-
dant of the Guo family? Nevertheless, this child is the same as his father, both were
stubborn. Once they made a decision what other people say would be useless.”
Thereupon she asked, “How are you going to report to the Great Khan?”

“I will tell the Great Khan the truth,” Guo Jing answered.

Li Ping was willing to support her son’s intention. “Good,” she said, “We can’t put this
off much longer. Go ahead and say thank you to the Great Khan, we, mother and son,
will leave for the south even today.” Guo Jing nodded his approval.

That very same evening mother and son prepared their bags. Other than a few changes
of clothes and some silvers, they left the Great Khan’s gifts in the tent.

As soon as they were finished Guo Jing said, “I am going to take my leave from the
Princess.”

Li Ping hesitated, “How can you tell her? We’d better leave quietly, spare her the
heartache,” she said.

“No,” Guo Jing said, “I will personally tell her.” Leaving his tent, he walked towards
Huazheng’s tent.

Huazheng and her mother lived in a big tent; they were busy discussing the wedding
preparation. Suddenly Huazheng heard Guo Jing’s voice calling her from outside the
tent. She was blushing, “Ma!” she said.

Her mother smiled, “You are going to get married in a few days, yet you cannot bear
not to see each other for just a day. All right, you may go.”

Huazheng smiled and walked out the tent. “Guo Jing Gege [big brother],” she called.

“Meizi [younger sister], I have something I need to tell you,” Guo Jing said. He led her
walking to the west. Two people walked several li’s into the prairie, far from the big
camp, and sat side by side on the grass.

Huazheng leaned against Guo Jing’s body. Lowering her head she said, “Jing Gege, I also
have something I want to tell you.”

Guo Jing was slightly startled, “Ah! So you know already?” he said. He thought it would
be better for her to find out, since he did not know where to start.

“Know what?” Huazheng was confused, “I wanted to tell you that I am not the Great
Khan’s daughter.”

“What?” Guo Jing was surprised.

Huazheng lifted up her eyes toward the crescent moon on the horizon, she slowly said,
“After I am married to you, I will forget that I am the Great Khan’s daughter, I am only
Guo Jing’s wife. If you want to beat me or scold me, go ahead and do it. Don’t think that
because my father is the Great Khan you have to submit to me.”

Guo Jing felt a mixture of bitter-sweet and warm and fuzzy feeling in his heart, he said,
“Meizi, you treated me very well. It’s a pity I don’t deserve to have you.”

“What do you mean you don’t deserve me?” Huazheng countered, “You are the kindest
man in the world, except for my father, nobody is better than you. Even my four elder
brothers don’t hold a candle compared to you.”

Guo Jing was silent for a long time; he was going to leave Mongolia for the south early
in the morning the next day, yet he did not know how to tell her.

Huazheng continued, “These past several days I have been so happy. I remember that
time when I heard you had died I was going to die with you. Lucky for me Brother
Tuolei snatched the dagger from my hand; otherwise how can I marry you now? Guo
Jing Gege, I’d rather die than not being your wife.”

Guo Jing silently thought, “Rong’er won’t talk to me like this; but both of them are very
kind to me.” Thinking about Huang Rong he could not help letting out a long sigh.

“Uh, why did you sigh?” Huazheng wondered.
