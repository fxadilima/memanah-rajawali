Reverend Yideng lowered his head and sighed, “Actually I only have myself to blame
for this unfortunate disaster. You see, my Dali kingdom is small; although it cannot be
compared to the Chinese emperor’s palace where there are more than 3,000 women,
speaking about the empress and concubines, I had a few. Ay! It truly was a sin. I was
very fond of martial arts; very seldom did I come near a woman. Even my own em-
press could see me only once every few days; how much less time did I have for my
concubines?”

Speaking to this point he said to his four disciples, “This is an inside story, you did not
know the details before. Today I am going to tell you everything so you’ll understand.”

Huang Rong thought, “They really did not know it, they did not lie to me.”

Yideng continued, “Day in and day out my concubines saw I train martial arts. Some
were interested and expressed their desire to learn. So I casually gave directions to one
or two of them. I thought by learning martial arts they would be healthier and might
have a longer life. Among them a concubine surnamed Liu was the most gifted. She
was so smart that each time I taught her something she would understand everything
right off. She was young and she trained hard everyday; her martial art advanced
greatly. And so it happened one day as she was practicing martial art in the garden she
met Zhou Botong, Zhou Shixiong [Martial Brother Zhou] quite by accident. First of all
Zhou Shixiong was crazy about martial arts; his natural disposition was also naïve, he
did not guard against male-female relationship. He saw Concubine Liu was training en-
thusiastically, immediately he came forward and sparred with her. Zhou Shixiong’s
martial art came from his martial brother, Wang Zhenren [lit. true/real man, a respect-
ful term to address a Taoist priest]; how could Concubine Liu be his match ...?”

“Aiyo!” Huang Rong softly exclaimed, “He did not know whether his hand was light or
heavy and has injured Concubine Liu?”

“Nobody was injured,” Reverend Yideng answered, “Only about three moves or two
stances later he sealed Concubine Liu’s acupoint, and then he asked if she would admit
defeat or not. Naturally Concubine Liu admitted defeat. Zhou Shixiong unsealed her
acupoint. He was so proud of himself that he started to talk about the wonderful secret
of sealing acupoint technique. Concubine Liu had actually asked me to teach her the
acupoint sealing technique before; but just think about it: how could I pass on this pro-
found martial art to an imperial concubine? What she heard from Zhou Shixiong was
exactly what she desired. Immediately she respectfully asked him to teach her.”

“(Sigh)! The Old Urchin must be very happy,” Huang Rong said.

“You know Zhou Shixiong?” Yideng asked.

Huang Rong laughed, “We are old acquaintances; he stayed at the Peach Blossom Island
for more than ten years, never once leave the island even for a single step.”

“With his character, how can he stay that long?” Yideng wondered.

Huang Rong smiled, “My father imprisoned him, and he was released just recently.”

“That’s so,” Yideng nodded his head, “Is Zhou Shixiong well?” he asked.

Huang Rong replied, “His body is well, but the older he gets the crazier he becomes. He
doesn’t have any manners.” Pointing her finger to Guo Jing she pursed her lips and con-
tinued with a smile, “The Old Urchin has performed a ritual to become sworn brothers
with him.”
