Segera setelah itu ia mengangkat jangkar. Sementara perahu itu bebas, arus deras menghanyutkannya. Perahu itu belok mendadak ketika lambungnya miring ke samping dan meluncur deras seolah-olah terbang menyusuri sungai._  |

Mu Nianci let Huang Rong hold her right hand; she looked at the fallen flowers floating
on the water and said, “When I saw him kill Ouyang Ke I thought he was going to re-
pent from his evil ways. Moreover I saw the two masters from the Beggar Clan were so
respectful toward him when they went to the west. I’ve met those two Beggar Clan uncles before; 
they were Senior Qigong’s trusted aides. Seeing them treat him that way I was very happy; 
so I followed them till we get to Yuezhou, where the Beggar Clan was having their congress on Mount Jun."

"Before then he quietly told me that he had received Hong Enshi’s [Benevolent Master
Hong] order to become the Beggar Clan’s Bangzhu [Clan Leader]. I was surprised and
happy. In all honesty it was hard to believe, but I saw even the highest ranking Elders
of the Beggar Clan treat him with utmost respect, I didn’t have any choice but to believe
him. I am not a member of the Beggar Clan, so naturally I could not participate in the
congress and had to wait for him in Yuezhou city. I thought that as he become the
leader of the Beggar Clan heroes he would be able to do much good for the people and
the country, to achieve great things, and in the future would be able to repel the in-
vaders and avenge adoptive father and mother."

"That night my mind went back and forth and I couldn’t sleep; I thought from now on
everything would be all right. It was almost daybreak when I finally felt tired and was
about to fall asleep when suddenly he jumped in from the window. I jumped in fright; I
thought he was having some ideas towards me. But he actually spoke in low voice,
‘Meizi [younger sister, term of endearment], things did not go well, we must go.’ I was
surprised and asked him what happened; he said, ‘There was an internal dispute in the
Beggar Clan; the Dirty Clothes Faction refused to accept Hong Bangzhu’s order. The
Clean Clothes Faction and the Dirty Clothes Faction battled each other in this new Clan
Leader business; many people were killed.’ I was shocked, ‘What should we do?’ I
asked. He said, ‘Because too many people has died, I withdrew my nomination, I did not
want to become the Clan Leader anymore.’ Taking the entire situation into considera-
tion, I thought he was doing the right thing. He said further, ‘The Clean Clothes Faction
did not want to let me go; fortunately Qiu Bangzhu from the Iron Palm Clan came to my
assistance and helped me leave Mount Jun. Right now we’d better go to the Iron Palm
Mountain first and we’ll talk it over later.’ I did not know whether the Iron Palm Clan
was a good clan or an evil one; but since he said so, I followed him."

"When we got to the Iron Palm Mountain, I did not see the Qiu Bangzhu from the Iron
Palm Clan, but I was watched over with cold eyes. I noticed that the Iron Palm Clan’s
behavior was sneaky, I saw strange things everywhere. I said to him, ‘Although you did
not become the Beggar Clan leader, you shouldn’t walk away from them. I think you’d
better find your Shifu, the Changchun Zi [Eternal Spring] Qiu Daozhang [Taoist Priest],
and ask him to gather the heroes of the Jianghu to uphold the justice, to help the Beggar
Clan elect a person of virtue and prestige within their clan to assume the Clan Leader
position to avoid a bloodbath within the clan. Hence you will be fulfilling Hong Enshi’s
order to you.’ He mumbled indistinctly, neither said yes nor no; but actually raised the
matter of his marriage with me. I rebuked him severely; he became angry. We ended
up having a heated argument. The next day I started to regret my harshness; I thought even 
though he could not differentiate the important from the trivial, friends from foe, 
and oftentimes acted childish, nevertheless he was always kind to me. I felt I was being 
too hard on him, no wonder he was mad at me. That evening the more I thought about it the 
more restless I became. I lit a lamp to write a note, saying I did not blame him. Quietly 
I went to his room; I was going to slip the note through his window, but suddenly I heard him 
talking with somebody. I took a peek from the window; I saw a rather short white-bearded
old man, he was wearing a yellow coarse-linen short robe, with a large palm leaf fan in
his hand.”

Guo Jing and Huang Rong exchanged glances, they both thought, “I wonder if he was
Qiu Qianren or Qiu Qianzhang?”

Mu Nianci continued, “That old man took a small porcelain vial from his pocket and
put it on the table, he said, ‘Brother Yang, if your fiancée does not listen to you, that is a
very simple matter. Just take some medicinal powder from this vial and put it in a cup
of green tea, let her drink it, I guarantee you will enjoy a wedding night tonight.”

As Jing and Rong two people heard this, they both thought, “It was Qiu Qianzhang.”

Mu Nianci continued, “To my surprise that boy Yang Kang beamed with joy and repeat-
edly said thanks. I was so angry that I almost passed out. A moment later that old man
took his leave. Quietly I followed behind him. After it was far enough, I pounced on
him, I beat his chest and struck him down. If I were not in a dangerous place, I
would’ve taken a knife and killed him right then and there. I repeatedly hit him until
he passed out, then I searched his body. This old man’s pocket really did contain many
things; some rings, broken sword, a piece of brick, and all kinds of strange things. I
think all of them are things to harm people. I also found a book. I didn’t know what it
was, but I thought it might be useful somehow, so I put it in my pocket. The more I
thought, the madder I became. I made up my mind to deal with Yang Kang.

I went back to Yang Kang’s room. Who would have thought that he was standing at the
door? He smiled at me and said, ‘Meizi, please come in.’ Early on I have decided that
tonight I must make myself clear to him, so I went in. He pointed to the porcelain vial
on the table and smiled, ‘Meizi,’ he said, ‘Can you guess what’s inside this vial?’ I was
angry, ‘Who knows all these kinds of dirty things?’ I said. He smiled and said, ‘A friend
gave it to me a moment ago, he said if I take some of this medicinal powder and put it
in a cup of green tea and give it to you, then everything will happen as I wish.’ His
words have actually blown me away, my anger vanished immediately. I took that
porcelain vial and threw it out over the window. ‘Did you do it?’ I asked. ‘I respect and
adore Meizi like a deity, how can I engage myself in this kind of filthy business?’ he
replied.”
