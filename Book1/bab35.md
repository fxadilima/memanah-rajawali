Huang Rong menggerakkan tongkat bambunya, terus-menerus melecut mereka. Menjelang senja mereka tiba di Kuil Tombak Besi. Di atas pagoda yang tinggi di dekat kuil, burung-burung gagak telah membuat sarang dari generasi ke generasi. Ribuan burung gagak terbang kian kemari di udara._ |

As the boat reached the shore, twenty, thirty people came ashore; among them were
Peng Lianhu, Sha Tongtian and their company. The last ones to come ashore were two
men, one tall the other short; the tall one was the Great Jin’s Prince Zhao, Wanyan
Honglie, the short one was the Clan Leader of the Iron Palm Clan, Qiu Qianren.

Apparently Wanyan Honglie relied on Ouyang Feng and Qiu Qianren to help them; so
he was confident they would win this martial contest, hence he went as far as person-
ally come over to Jiangnan.

Pointing to Qiu Qianren Huang Rong said, “Father, this old man has hit your daughter
with his palm that I nearly lost my life.”

At the Cloud Village Huang Yaoshi had seen Qiu Qianren’s disgraceful act; he did not
know it was actually Qiu Qianzhang in disguise. He thought it was strange how with
just a little bit of trick this man could injure his daughter.

In the meantime Ouyang Feng was having a discussion with Wanyan Honglie and the
others; they were talking in a low voice. After about half a day Ouyang Feng came to

Hong Qigong and said, “Qi Xiong, you have said that in the upcoming martial art con-
test you are not going to help either side, haven’t you?”
Hong Qigong said in his heart, “I have the desire but am powerless; even if I want to
help I don’t have the ability to do so.” With no other choice he replied, “Contest or no
contest, I said the fifteenth of the eighth month.”

“That is so,” Ouyang Feng said, “Yao Xiong, the Quanzhen Sect and the Seven Freaks of
Jiangnan are seeking enmity with you; you are a grandmaster and a senior, it will be
below your dignity to deal with these people. Let Xiong Di [younger brother, referring
to himself] deal with them on your behalf, you can just stand on the side and be the
spectator, what do you say?”

Huang Yaoshi thought about the battle situation from both sides’ point of view: if Hong
Qigong did not go into action, the Quanzhen Masters would certainly fall under Ouyang
Feng’s deadly hand, thus the Quanzhen Sect faced an imminent destruction. If Guo Jing
helped them by defending the ‘tian xuan’, Ouyang Feng would not be the Big Dipper
Formation’s match; but if this dumb kid kept pestering Huang Yaoshi, the situation
would not be the same, he thought, “This kid Guo Jing is still wet behind his ears, the
Quanzhen Sect’s life or death, fortune or disaster, actually depends on him. If Wang
Chongyang in the underworld knew, all he could do is to laugh bitterly.”

Ouyang Feng saw that he looked indifferent without answering his question, if Zhou
Botong arrived, the situation would be detrimental to him; therefore, he let out a long
laugh and called out, “Everybody, attack! What are you waiting for?”

Hong Qigong was angry, “Was that a human speaking or a dog farting?”

Ouyang Feng pointed to the sky and said with a smile, “’Zi shi’ [first hour, midnight, be-
tween 11pm and 1 am] has passed, right now it is already early morning of the fif-
teenth of the eighth month.”

Hong Qigong looked up only to see that the moon had slightly shifted to the west, half
of it was still covered by the dark clouds, it was indeed the end of the ‘zi shi’ and the
start of ‘chou shi’ [second hour, between 1 am and 3 am].

Ouyang Feng’s snake staff struck, its target was Qiu Chuji’s chest. Facing their archen-
emy, with Peng Lianhu watching intently on the side, ready to strike, the Quanzhen Six
Masters knew that the slightest mistake today would result in their demise; hence they
pulled themselves together immediately and fought Ouyang Feng with all their might,
but after just a few stances, the six of them groaned inwardly.
