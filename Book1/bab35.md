Huang Rong menggerakkan tongkat bambunya, terus-menerus melecut mereka. Menjelang senja mereka tiba di Kuil Tombak Besi. Di atas pagoda yang tinggi di dekat kuil, burung-burung gagak telah membuat sarang dari generasi ke generasi. Ribuan burung gagak terbang kian kemari di udara._ |

***

Begitu kapal itu mencapai tepian, dua sampai tiga puluh orang turun ke pantai, di antara mereka ada Peng Lianhu,
Sha Tongtian dan kawan-kawan. Yang terakhir mendaratkan kaki adalah dua orang, yang satu tinggi dan yang lainnya 
pendek. Orang yang bertubuh tinggi itu adalah Pangeran Zhao dari Jin Agung, Wanyan Honglie, sedangkan yang pendek 
adalah Ketua Sekte Telapak Besi, Qiu Qianren.

Tampaknya Wanyan Honglie mengandalkan Ouyang Feng dan Qiu Qianren untuk membantu mereka, maka ia sangat percaya 
diri mereka akan memenangkan kontes ilmu silat, karena itu ia rela datang secara pribadi ke Jiangnan.

Sambil menunjuk Qiu Qianren Huang Rong berkata, "Ayah, orang tua ini memukul anakmu dengan telapak tangannya, 
aku nyaris kehilangan nyawa."

Di Rumah Awan Huang Yaoshi telah melihat kelakuan buruk Qiu Qianren, ia tidak tahu bahwa itu sebenarnya adalah 
Qiu Qianzhang yang sedang menyamar. Ia mengira adalah sangat aneh dengan mengandalkan tipuan kecil orang ini 
sanggup melukai putrinya.

Pada saat itu Ouyang Feng sedang berdiskusi dengan Wanyan Honglie dan yang lain, mereka berbicara dengan suara rendah.
Setelah agak lama Ouyang Feng mendatangi Hong Qigong dan berkata, "Qi Xiong, kau sudah bilanh bahwa dalam kontes 
ilmu silat ini kau tidak akan membantu pihak manapun, kan?" 

Dalam hati Hong Qigong berkata, "Aku punya minat, tapi tak punya kekuatan, kalaupun aku ingin membantu aku juga 
tidak punya kemampuan untuk melakukannya." Tak punya pilihan lain, ia pun menjawab, "Ada kontes atau tidak, aku sudah 
bilang, itu tanggal lima belas bulan delapan."

"Begitu," kata Ouyang Feng. "Yao Xiong, Quanzhen dan Tujuh Orang Aneh dari Jiangnan bermusuhan denganmu. Kau adalah 
seorang guru besar dan seorang Qianbei, akan tidak pantas kalau kau turun tangan sendiri menangani orang-orang ini.
Biarkan Xiongdi yang menangani mereka untukmu, kau bisa berdiri di samping dan menonton, bagaimana menurutmu?"

Huang Yaoshi memikirkan situasi pertarungan dari sudut pandang kedua belah pihak. Kalau Hong Qigong tidak ikut beraksi,
Perguruan Quanzhen pasti akan jatuh di tangan maut Ouyang Feng, maka berarti Perguruan Quanzhen menghadapi bencana
dalam waktu dekat. Kalau Guo Jing membela mereka dengan mengambil posisi Tian Xuan, maka Ouyang Feng tidak akan bisa 
menandingi Formasi Tujuh Bintang Utara. Tetapi kalau anak bodoh ini terus-terusan mengganggu Huang Yaoshi, maka
situasinya tidak akan sama, ia berpikir, "Bocah Guo Jing ini masih hijau, masalah hidup-mati Quanzhen, keberuntungan 
atau malapetaka, sungguh-sungguh tergantung pada dia. Kalau Wang Chongyang di akhirat tahu, yang bisa dilakukannya 
hanyalah tertawa pahit."

Ouyang Feng melihat bahwa ia tampak acuh tak acuh tanpa menjawab pertanyaannya, jika Zhou Botong datang, maka 
situasi akan merugikan baginya, karena itu ia tertawa dan berseru, "Semuanya, serbu! Kalian tunggu apa lagi?"

Hong Qigong marah. "Itu omongan manusia atau kentut anjing?"

Ouyang Feng menunjuk ke langit dan berkata sambil tersenyum, "Zi shi[^zi-shi] sudah lewat, saat ini sudah dini hari
tanggal lima belas bulan delapan."

[^zi-shi]: Zi Shi (子时) adalah jam pertama, tengah malam, antara jam 11 malam dan jam 1 dini hari, menurut aturan umum yang kita kenal. Arti literal kedua karakter tersebut adalah 'Jam Tikus'. Informasi mengenai ini bisa dibaca di [situs ini](https://www.thespruce.com/chinese-zodiac-signs-hours-of-the-day-chart-1275138).

[^chou-shi]: Chou Shi (丑时) adalah jam kedua, yaitu antara jam 1 dan jam 3 dini hari. Secara literal istilah tersebut berarti 'Jam Kerbau'.

Hong Qigong mendongak dan melihat bahwa bulan telah bergeser sedikit ke arah barat, setengahnya masih tertutup awan gelap,
ini memang benar adalah akhir dari Zi Shi dan dimulainya Chou Shi[^chou-shi].

Tongkat ular Ouyang Feng menyerang, sasarannya adalah dada Qiu Chuji. Menghadapi musuh bebuyutan mereka, Peng Lianhu 
menonton dengan penuh perhatian di samping, siap menyerang. Enam Pendekar Quanzhen tahu bahwa kesalahan sedikit saja 
akan membuat mereka tewas, maka dari itu mereka membulatkan tekad dan melawan Ouyang Feng dengan segenap hati, tetapi 
hanya dalam beberapa jurus mereka berenam mengeluh dalam hati.

Kali ini niat Ouyang feng adalah untuk memamerkan kekuatannya di hadapan semua orang, semua jurus yang ditampilkannya
sangat cepat dan mematikan, khususnya kedua ular yang ada di kepala tongkatnya, yang maju mundur, menyerang atau 
mengelak dalam gerakan mendadak, pada hakekatnya tidak mungkin dilawan. Qiu Chuji, Wang Chuyi dan yang lain beberapa 
kali mencoba untuk menikam ular-ular itu, tetapi mereka tidak bisa mengimbangi kecepatannya.

Huang Rong melihat Guo Jing masih menatap ayahnya dengan marah. Hanya karena Hong Qigong menghalanginya ia tidak berani 
menyerang. Ia tiba-tiba terinspirasi dan berkata, "Sepajang hari ngomong soal membalas dendam ayahnya, hmm, sekarang 
pembunuhnya ada di sini tapi dia takut."

Kata-katanya mengingatkan Guo Jing, ia mengalihkan pandangannya kepada Huang Rong dan berpikir, "Membunuh anjing Jin itu 
dulu, baru kemudian mencari Huang Yaoshi juga masih belum terlambat." Sambil menghunus pisaunya ia menerjang ke arah 
Wanyan Honglie.

Secara serempak Sha Tongtian dan Penglianhu maju untuk menghadang di depan Wanyan Honglie. Guo Jing memutar pergelangan 
tangannya dan belati di tangannya menikam miring ke bawah. Peng Lianhu menangkis dengan sepasang penanya, 'tring!'
senjata-senjata itu beradu dan ia merasakan sensasi kesemutan di telapak tangannya. Guo Jing berturut-turut melewati
dua orang. Teknik Yi Xing Huan Wei[^ilmu-pindah] milik Sha Tongtian juga tidak bisa menahan langkahnya. Buru-buru 
Sha Tongtian berusaha mengejarnya. Lingzhi Shangren dan Lian Ziweng masing-masing dengan senjata di tangan 
memposisikan diri untuk menghadang Guo Jing.

Guo Jing berkelebat ke samping untuk menghindari dua Jarum Penembus Tulang[^tou-gu-ding] milik Liang Ziweng,
kedua tangannya, satu dengan belati dan yang lain telapak tangan kosong, melancarkan Di Yang Chu Fan[^di-yang-chu-fan],
melemparkan tubuhnya ke depan.

[^tou-gu-ding]: Tou Gu Ding (透骨钉) bisa diartikan 'Jarum Penembus Tulang'. Sebetulnya karakter Ding (钉) lebih cocok kalau kita artikan 'Paku', tetapi senjata rahasia Lian Ziweng sebelumnya digambarkan 'sangat halus dan tipis', karena itu istilah 'paku' terasa kurang cocok.

[^di-yang-chu-fan]: Di Yang Chu Fan (羝羊触藩) adalah sebuah ungkapan yang terdapat di dalam Kitab Perubahan (Yijing). Biasanya digunakan untuk menggambarkan dilema yang dialami seseorang. Arti literal 4 karakter tersebut adalah 'kambing/domba jantan yang tanduknya diikat ke sebuah pagar'.

Liang Ziweng melihat bahwa tenaga yang datang sangat cepat dan dahsyat, ia bergulingan menjauh di tanah untuk 
menghindarinya.

Liang Ziweng saw that the incoming force was swift and fierce; he rolled away on the
ground to evade. Lingzhi Shangren was big and fat, he was not as agile; he thought if he
evaded, the enemy would have clear access to the Prince Zhao, so he raised his pair of
cymbals, trying to block this attack. With two loud ‘Bang! Bang!’ his hands were shaken
and the two cymbals flew to the air, while the wind from Guo Jing’s palm continued
hacking toward his face. Relying on the strength of, and poison on, his palms, Lingzhi
Shangren fended off Guo Jing’s palm, only to feel his chest constricted and his arm sore
and numb; his palms hang loosely down, his wrist joints were shaken and to his shock
he could not use his poisonous palm skill. He stood dumbly without knowing what to
do. If Guo Jing took this opportunity and sent out a palm, he could easily take Lingzhi
Shangren’s life, but he remembered his main target was Wanyan Honglie, so he did not
give Lingzhi Shangren another look.

The pair of copper cymbals flew in the air and glimmering under the moonlight one af-
ter another they fell back down to the earth. ‘Bang!’ the first cymbal landed on Lingzhi
Shangren’s head. Luckily it was in a horizontal position; otherwise with its knife-like
sharp edge it would chop the Tibetan monk’s bald head in two. Another loud ‘Bang!’ fol-
lowed, louder and brighter than the first; the second cymbal landed on the first, creat-
ing a continuous buzzing noise, which reached far into the lake and echoed back on the
surface of the lake.

Wanyan Honglie saw how Guo Jing was able to go through four martial art masters
without missing a step and suddenly arrive in front of him, he was unable to restrain
his great shock and cried out, “Aiyo!” while turning his body around and run away.

With the dagger in his hand Guo Jing chased him; but he only managed to pursue sev-
eral steps when suddenly a yellow shadow flashed by, a pair of palms came slanting
down on him. Guo Jing stepped aside to evade, while the dagger in his hand stabbed
forward; but his body was swayed by the incoming palms; hastily he steadied his step
and saw that the enemy was the Clan Leader of the Iron Palm Clan, Qiu Qianren. Guo
Jing knew the enemy’s martial art skill is superior to his own, so he would not be able
to pursue his personal enemy; immediately, with the dagger in his right hand and a
bare palm on his left, he focused his attention to fight the enemy.

Peng Lianhu knew the critical situation had passed as he saw Guo Jing was tied down
by Qiu Qianren while Liang Ziweng and Sha Tongtian were guarding in front of
Wanyan Honglie; he turned his attention to Ke Zhen’E and said with a smile, “Ke Daxia,
how come only one freak out of the Seven Freaks of Jiangnan showed up?”

Ke Zhen’E’s iron staff was thrown into the Southern Lake by Huang Rong; hearing the
enemy’s insult he waved his hand to send out an iron caltrop, while he immediately
jumped backward. Under the dim moonlight the iron caltrop looked so swift and pow-
erful. Peng Lianhu had experienced suffering because of this poisonous secret projec-
tile; he was scared like a bird was scared of a bow, he did not dare to fend off with his
judge pen, so he hastily pushed the pens on the ground to using it as a brace to help
him jump high in the air. With a ‘swish’ sound the iron caltrop barely missed the bot-
tom of his foot. He noticed Ke Zhen’E did not have any weapon in his hand; clenching
his teeth he struck forward with his pens.

Ke Zhen’E was disabled; he usually walked aided by his staff. He heard the wind as the
enemy attack arrived, he had no choice but using all his strength he leaped two steps to
the side, and almost fell down as his left foot landed on soft earth.

Peng Lianhu was delighted; with his left pen he guarded against Ke Zhen’E, should he
be desperate enough to launch an attack to save his own life, while his right pen
fiercely smashed down toward Ke Zhen’E’s chest.

Ke Zhen’E listened to the sound to distinguish the shape, he rolled away to evade. Peng
Lianhu’s steel judge pen struck a rock on the ground, sparks flew everywhere. “Blind
thief,” he cursed, “You are very slippery!” The pen in his left hand also struck.

While he was rolling away, ‘swish!’ he released another iron caltrop. Lingzhi Shangren
was standing nearby, his left hand was holding his right hand, his mouth was busy
cursing in Tibetan; as he saw Ke Zhen’E was rolling near him, he raised his foot trying
to trample him.

Ke Zhen’E heard the wind; using his left hand to brace the ground he threw himself
sideways to escape. But evading the Tibetan monk’s foot he could not escape the pair of
judge pen on his back. He felt a stabbing pain and secretly shouted, “Not good!” He
closed his eyes, ready to die. Suddenly he heard a tender voice called out, “Off you go!”
followed by “Aiyo!” finally he heard a loud ‘bang!’

Turned out Huang Rong used the Dog Beating Stick Technique to block the judge pen,
turned it around and jerked it up, throwing both the pen and Peng Lianhu away. This
stick technique was exactly the same stance Huang Rong used to fling Ke Zhen’E’s iron
staff away; only Peng Lianhu held his pens tight and would not let them go no matter
what, so both Peng Lianhu and his pen fell down together.

Peng Lianhu was shocked and angry at the same time, he crawled back up only to see
Huang Rong was using her stick to protect Ke Zhen’E, giving him the opportunity to
stand up. “Little witch [Translator’s note: the Chinese characters used were ‘xiao yao
nu’, with ‘yao’ being ‘goblin/witch/demon/monster’, see also Chapter 25], who asked for
your help?”

Ignoring him Huang Rong called out, “Father, look after this blind muddle-head, don’t
let anybody harm him.” While saying that she rushed toward Guo Jing to help him fight
Qiu Qianren.

Ke Zhen’E was dumbstruck; he stood motionless not knowing what to do. Peng Lianhu
saw Huang Yaoshi was standing quite a distant away, with his back facing them, appar-
ently he did not hear his daughter’s call. Quietly Peng Lianhu went behind Ke Zhen’E
and suddenly lunged his judge pen toward Ke Zhen’E’s back. This move was both swift
and violent, so much so that even if Ke Zhen’E still had the iron staff in his hand he
would not necessarily be able to block it. Peng Lianhu saw he was about to succeed
when suddenly a ‘swish’ sound was heard; something flew splitting the air, hit the
judge pen, and shattered into dust; turned out it was a small grain of gravel. Peng
Lianhu’s palm was numb and the judge pen fell to the ground.

Peng Lianhu was shocked; he did not know where the gravel came from, and how
could it carry such a tremendous force. He saw Huang Yaoshi with his hands behind his
back, still looking at the black clouds on the horizon.

At the Cloud Village Ke Zhen’E had heard this Divine Flicking Finger skill; he knew it
was Huang Yaoshi who saved him. In rage he pounced toward Huang Yaoshi’s back,
while shouting, “Seven brothers and sister only one left, why would I want to live?”

Huang Yaoshi still did not turn his head; he waited until Ke Zhen’E was about three feet
away before his left hand lightly waved backward. Ke Zhen’E felt a strong force push-
ing him back that he fell face up. Quickly he sat down, but felt his blood surging up his
chest and he was not able to stand up.

By this time the sky was getting darker, the fog hovering on the surface of the lake was
getting thicker, it spilled over to the ground; submerging everybody’s legs in it. Guo Jing
and Huang Rong managed to fight Qiu Qianren evenly. On the other side, the Quanzhen
Sect was in dire circumstances; Hao Datong’s thigh was swept by the snake staff, half of
Sun Bu’er’s Taoist robe was torn. Wang Chuyi was secretly alarmed; he knew that if this
fight continued, someone would be either dead or wounded before long. So when Ma
Yu and Liu Chuxuan were launching a flank attack, he took a rocket from his pocket.

With a hissing sound the rocket flew up to the sky, like a meteor with a long tail in the
dark sky.

Actually, all Seven Masters of the Quanzhen Sect had accepted not a few disciples; they
formed quite a number of the third generation disciples. Besides Yin Zhiping, there
were Li Zhichang, Zhang Zhijing, Wang Zhitan, Qi Zhicheng, Zhang Zhixian, Zhao
Zhijing, and the others; they were all outstanding people. In the martial art contest at
Misty Rain Tavern in Jiaxing this time, the Seven Masters were afraid that Peng Lianhu,
Sha Tongtian and the others would bring their disciples in their attempt to gain victory
by sheer numbers; therefore, they also took their disciples along to Jiaxing and told
them to wait by the shore of the Southern Lake. As soon as they saw the rocket they
were supposed to immediately come and render their assistance. So now recognizing
their precarious situation Wang Chuyi released the rocket. Unfortunately the fog was
too thick; even separated by several feet it was already difficult to distinguish people,
so he was afraid the disciples would not be able to see through this fog.

Later on, after fighting a little while, the white fog was getting heavier, everybody was
enveloped inside the thick fog that they suddenly felt alone. The gathering dark clouds
in the sky were getting thicker and thicker; the dim moonlight which penetrated these
layers of cloud was getting weaker and weaker, until finally it disappeared all together.
Everybody was alarmed; although they did not stop fighting, the distance between
them were getting farther and farther away, their stances were most of the time defen-
sives and very few offensives.

Guo Jing and Huang Rong were fighting Qiu Qianren together; suddenly the thick fog
welled up and shrouded these three people. Guo Jing saw Qiu and Huang two people
suddenly disappear, he decided to look for Wanyan Honglie immediately. His eyes were
wide open, trying to catch a glimpse of the flashing of the golden crown on Wanyan
Honglie’s head. But the fog was very dense; he could not even see anything beyond
three feet. He hurried to the east and dashed to the west to seek the enemy, suddenly he
heard someone was calling out in the fog, “Zhou Botong is here, who wants to fight
with me?”

Guo Jing was ecstatic, he was about to reply but Qiu Chuji beat him, “Zhou Shishu [mar-
tial uncle], are you Senior well?”

Right at this moment the dark clouds revealed a gap and suddenly everybody could see
their enemies were actually almost within reach of each other, if anybody launched
any attack, they would certainly be injured. As if by prior agreement they all cried out
in alarm and leaped back.

Zhou Botong was giggling as he stood among these people, he said in a loud voice,
“There are so many people here, very lively. Wonderful! Wonderful!” His right hand
reached beneath the crook of his left elbow, he rubbed some dirt and rolled it, he said,
“I’ll give you some poison!” and he shoved the dirt into Sha Tongtian’s mouth nearby.

Sha Tongtian quickly evaded, but although he used his ‘yi xing huan wei’, he was still
not fast enough; his left arm was grabbed by Zhou Botong and the dirt was squeezed
into his mouth. He had suffered quite a bit under Zhou Botong’s hand, he knew if he
spat the dirt, he would certainly be beaten; therefore, he had no choice but stay silent
and keep the dirt in his mouth. He knew the dirt was not poison, so he certainly was
not afraid.

As Wang Chuyi saw Zhou Botong suddenly arrive he was overjoyed, “Shishu,” he called
out, “Turned out it’s true that you are not killed by Huang Daozhu [Island Master].”

“Who said I am dead?” Zhou Botong angrily asked, “The Old Heretic Huang had always
wanted to harm me, but it’s been more than ten years and he still has not succeeded
yet. Ha, Old Heretic Huang, come and try again.” While saying that he waved his fist to-
ward Huang Yaoshi’s shoulder.

Huang Yaoshi did not dare to ignore him; he counterattacked with a stance from the
‘shen jian luo ying zhang’ [divine sword falling leaves palm] while calling out at the
same time, “The mixed-up hairs from Quanzhen Sect blamed me of killing you, they are
pestering me without any reason, saying that they were seeking revenge for you.”

Zhou Botong was angry, “You killed me? Are you dreaming? When did you kill me?
Look clearly, am I a human or am I a ghost?” While spouting nonsense he fought faster
and faster.

Huang Yaoshi knew Zhou Botong would not listen to reason, and he was attacking him
out of a whim, but his moves were very exquisite and marvelous; Huang Yaoshi had no
choice but fight him with all his might.

The Quanzhen Masters thought that as soon as their Shishu arrived, he would join
hands with Huang Yaoshi to fight Ouyang Feng; who would have thought that this
Shishu did not want to listen to them but entangled Huang Yaoshi in a close combat in-
stead. “Shishu, don’t fight with Huang Daozhu!” Ma Yu repeatedly called.

Ouyang Feng interjected, “That’s right Old Urchin, you are in no way the Old Heretic’s
match; quickly run away to save your life! Quick, quick!”

Listening to this provocation Zhou Botong was all the more not willing to give up.
Huang Rong called out, “Old Urchin, you use the martial art from the Nine Yin Manual
to fight my father; what would your Shixiong [martial brother] say in the underworld?”

Zhou Botong burst out in laughter, he sounded very smug when he said, “Look care-
fully, do you see I am using the martial art from the Manual? I have spent a great deal
of effort trying to forget the Manual. Hey, hey, learning was easy, forgetting is actually a
lot of trouble! What I am using now is the 72-stance Vacant Fist, the Old Urchin’s very
own creation, do you think it is the same as the Nine Yin Manual even for a fart?”

When fighting him at the Peach Blossom Island, Huang Yaoshi thought his fist and kick
strength was much stronger; now he saw that although his fist technique was refined
and wonderful, the strength was actually less than he remembered, but Zhou Botong
was able to fight evenly with him, which he thought was very strange. Listening to
Zhou Botong’s words Huang Yaoshi was secretly impressed; regardless of what kind of
bizarre technique he employed, Zhou Botong was able to create an excellent martial art
all by himself and thus he founded his own martial art school.

From inside the fog Ouyang Feng could indistinctly see the fight between Zhou Botong
and Huang Yaoshi; he was inwardly very happy, but was also afraid that as soon as he
defeated Huang Yaoshi Zhou Botong would join hands with the Quanzhen Masters and
deal with him. Thereupon he thought as he had the opportunity, he should break the
Big Dipper Formation first. Immediately he wielded his snake staff and pressed on bit
by bit, placing the Big Dipper Formation in more and more dangerous situation.

Wang Chuyi and Liu Chuxuan called out, “Zhou Shishu, kill Ouyang Feng first!”

Zhou Botong saw his martial nephews’ desperate situation, with a left palm and a right
fist he swept horizontally. When he was very close to Huang Yaoshi’s face, suddenly
with a laughter the fist changed into a palm and the palm became a fist, continuing
their attack across each other.

Huang Yaoshi had never anticipated this kind of strange move, he hurriedly raised his
arms to block, but the tip of his eyebrow was brushed lightly by the edge of Zhou
Botong’s palm. He was not injured, but Huang Yaoshi felt his eyebrow was burning hot.

As Zhou Botong’s palm brushed his opponent suddenly he was shocked; his left hand
slapped his own right wrist and he cursed, “Damn it! Damn it! This is the martial art
from the Nine Yin Manual!”

Huang Yaoshi was slightly startled; but his palm had already struck with a lightning
fast speed, without any noise landed on Zhou Botong’s shoulder. Zhou Botong bent his
waist and shrunk his shoulder. “Aiyo!” he cried out, “The payback is so quick!”

Meanwhile the fog was getting thicker; it was getting more difficult to see anything.
Guo Jing was afraid his two shifus would be injured; he held out his hand to help Ke
Zhen’E, pulling his arm toward Hong Qigong. With a low voice he said, “Two Shifus,
please take a rest at the Misty Rain Tavern; we’ll wait for the fog to recede then we’ll
talk again.” He heard Huang Rong called out, “Old Urchin, are you going to obey me or
not?”

“I can’t beat your father,” Zhou Botong replied, “So don’t worry.”

“I want you to beat the Old Poison,” Huang Rong said, “Just don’t kill him.”

“Why?” Zhou Botong asked; but his hands and feet were not slowing down.

Huang Rong called out, “If you don’t do what I say, I am going to reveal your stinky
history.”

“What stinky history?” Zhou Botong asked, “You talk nonsense.”

“All right,” with deliberation Huang Rong said, “Four weaving machines, the weaving of
mandarin ducks desiring to fly together right away.”

Hearing these two sentences Zhou Botong was so scared that it was as if his soul had
left him; “All right, all right, I’ll listen to you,” he busily said, “Old Poison, where are
you?” He heard Ma Yu’s voice penetrating the thick fog, “Zhou Shishu, occupy the north
polar star to surround him.”
Huang Rong said again, “Father, this Qiu Qianren collaborates with a foreign kingdom,
he is a big traitor; please kill him quickly.”

“Child,” Huang Yaoshi said, “Come to my side.” In the heavy fog he could not see where
Qiu Qianren was. But he heard Zhou Botong was laughing a big laugh while calling out,
“Old Poison, quickly kneel down and kowtow to your grandfather; I’ll spare your life
today.”

Guo Jing sent Hong and Ke two people to the side of the tavern; then he turned his body
around, trying to find Wanyan Honglie. Who would have thought that as he left the
Misty Rain Tavern, not only he could not find Wanyan Honglie, but also Sha Tongtian,
Qiu Qianren and the others had all disappeared. He heard Zhou Botong call out, “Uh,
where is the Old Poison? Where did he run to?”

This fog was unusually thick, everybody was very close to each other, yet one could not
see the face of someone else standing next to them; they only saw a vague image of a
human form. Their voices were also somewhat muffled by the fog, as if there was some
layers separating each other. Each one of them was an experienced fighter, yet in this
battle they felt like they were blindfolded; not a single one of them was not anxious.
Huang Rong was leaning close to her father, Ma Yu was giving out orders in low voice
to shrink their circle. Everyone was straining their ears to listen to any enemy’s activ-
ity; for a moment nobody made any noise. A little while later suddenly Qiu Chuji called
out, “Listen! What’s that?”

They heard hissing noise all around them, strange noise from a distant coming near.
Huang Rong called out in alarm, “The Old Poison dispatches his snakes! Really
shameless!”

At the end of the tavern Hong Qigong had also heard the snakes, he loudly called out,
“It’s the Old Poison’s snake formation; everybody quickly come up the stairs!”

Zhou Botong’s martial art could be considered number one among those present, but
for all his life he was afraid of snakes, so with a loud cry he dashed wildly toward the
Misty Rain Tavern. He was afraid the snakes would bite his heel, so he skipped the up-
stairs room and utilizing his ‘qing gong’ [lightness kungfu] to the fullest he leaped onto
the roof, and sat on the highest ridge, still trembling with fear.

Not too long afterwards the sound of the snakes was getting louder. Huang Rong pulled
her father’s hand to go up the Misty Rain Tavern. Holding each other’s hand the
Quanzhen Masters were groping their way upstairs. Yin Zhiping stepped on a crack and
fell down real hard that his head grew a swollen lump; quickly he crawled back
upstairs.

Huang Rong had not heard Guo Jing’s voice, she was concerned; “Jing Gege, where are
you?” she called. After calling out several times she still had not heard any reply; she
became anxious and said, “Father, I am going back to look for him.”

Suddenly she heard Guo Jing’s cold voice, “Why should you look for me? Don’t call me; I
am not going to answer you.” It turned out he was right next to her.
