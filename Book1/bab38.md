Ouyang Feng mengulurkan tangannya dan meraih ujung lainnya. Guo Jing meremas kakinya dan berteriak keras. Kuda merah kecil itu dengan marah menyerbu ke depan dan dengan suara cipratan yang keras, Ouyang Feng ditarik keluar dari lumpur dan diseret ke tanah bersalju._ |

***

Guo Jing menemani Qiu Chuji dan kedelapan belas muridnya, di antara mereka ada Li Zhicang, Yin Zhiping, 
Xia Zhiceng, Yu Zhike, Zhang Zhisu, Wang Zhiming dan Song Defang. Ketika keluar dari istana, mereka melihat
Huang Rong dan ketiga penatua Kai Pang — Lu, Jian dan Liang Zhanglao — berikut sekitar seribu orang anggota 
Kai Pang di atas kuda. menunggu di luar istana.

Begitu melihat Guo Jing meninggalkan istana, Huang Rong menepuk kudanya supaya maju menyambutnya, sambil tersenyum
ia berkata, "Semuanya baik-baik saja?"

Guo Jing tersenyum. "Nasibku tidak jelek, Qiu Daozhang tiba tepat pada waktunya, mengubah suasana hati Khan Agung
menjadi lebih baik," katanya.

Huang Rong menyapa Qiu Chuji dengan hormat, kemudian ia menanyai Guo Jing lagi, "Aku takut kalau-kalau Khan Agung 
membunuhmu karena marah, makanya aku membawa semua orang ke sini untuk menyelamatkanmu. Apa kata Khan Agung? Dia setuju
membatalkan perkawinanmu?"

Guo Jing ragu-ragu agak lama sebelum menjawab, "Aku tidak menanyakannya."

"Kenapa?" tanya Huang Rong kaget.

"Rong'er, tolong jangan marah," kata Guo Jing. "Ini karena..." Tepat pada saat itu Putri Huazheng bergegas
keluar istana, memanggilnya dengan lantang, "Guo Jing Gege!"

Begitu melihatnya, air muka Huang Rong langsung berubah. Ia cepat-cepat menaiki kudanya dan memacunya pergi. Guo Jing 
baru hendak membuka mulut ketika Huazheng menarik tangannya dan berkata, "Apa kau tidak kaget aku ada di sini? Kau
senang melihatku?"

Guo Jing mengangguk. Ia memalingkan muka melihat Huang Rong, tetapi ia sudah menghilang. Mata Huazheng hanya 
terarah kepada Guo Jing, ia sama sekali tidak menyadari kehadiran Huang Rong. Ia menarik tangannya, tertawa,
cekikikan dan mengatakan betapa ia merindukan Guo Jing.

Guo Jing diam-diam mengeluh, "Rong'er pasti mengira aku tidak meminta Khan Agung membatalkan perkawinan gara-gara
aku melihat Huazheng." Ia diam dan tidak mendengar apa yang dikatakan Huazheng.

Sesaat kemudian Huazheng melihat bahwa Guo Jing sedang melamun, ia tersinggung. "Kau kenapa sih? Aku datang jauh-jauh
hanya untuk menemuimu, dan kau tidak memperhatikanku?"

"Meizi," kata Guo Jing. "Aku harus mengurus urusan yang sangat penting, kita bicara lagi waktu aku pulang." Tanpa 
menunggu jawaban Huazheng ia menugaskan pengawal pribadinya untuk mengurus Qiu Chuji, lalu buru-buru kembali ke
kemahnya, mencari Huang Rong.

Pengawalnya berkata, "Nona Huang kembali untuk membawa lukisan, lalu pergi ke arah pintu timur."

Guo Jing terkejut. "Lukisan apa?" tanyanya.

"Lukisan yang sering dilihat Pangeran[^pangeran-menantu]," jawab pengawalnya.

[^pangeran-menantu]: Pengawal itu memanggil Guo Jing Fu Ma Ye (驸马爷). Istilah Fuma (驸马, atau dalam karakter tradisional 駙馬), adalah sebutan bagi seorang pendamping dari seorang putri keluarga bangsawan, biasanya anak atau saudara perempuan raja. Gelar ini sama seperti 'Selir', tetapi ditujukan bagi seorang laki-laki. Karakter Ye (爷) yang ditambahkan itu artinya adalah 'Majikan', atau sama dengan 'Tuan'. Karena tidak ada istilah yang sama untuk 'Selir', yang ditujukan bagi seorang pria dalam bahasa Indonesia, maka sebaiknya kita pakai istilah 'Pangeran', karena seorang 'Selir' pada dasarnya juga dipanggil 'Putri'. Kita bisa membayangkan melompatnya status sosial Guo Jing dari seorang warga biasa dalam suku Genghis Khan, dan bahkan seorang keturunan Han, menjadi seorang Pangeran, hanya karena ia dijodohkan dengan Huazheng.

Sekarang Guo Jing benar-benar ngeri. "Dia mengambil lukisan ini, artinya dia sungguh-sungguh memutuskan hubungan 
denganku. Entah bagaimana caranya, aku harus pergi ke Selatan untuk mencarinya." Ia buru-buru menulis sebuah surat kepada 
Qiu Chuji, lalu menaiki kuda merahnya ia keluar dari kota untuk mengejar.

Kuda merah kecil itu sangat cepat, tapi Guo Jing takut tidak bisa melihat Huang Rong lagi, maka ia terus memacunya supaya
lari lebih cepat lagi. Dalam waktu singkat mereka telah menempuh jarak lebih dari sepuluh _li_, sudah berada di lingkar luar
kota. Para prajurit berkuda masih tetap berkeliaran di mana-mana. Beberapa puluh _li_ kemudian, yang bisa dilihatnya
hanya padang rumput yang luas diselimuti salju putih. Ia sangat gembira menemukan jejak kaki kuda di atas salju yang 
mengarah ke timur.

"Kuda merah ini begitu cepat, sampai tak seekor kuda pun di dunia ini bisa menandinginya. Sebentar lagi aku seharusnya bisa
mengejar Rong;er," pikirnya. "Aku akan membawa ibu, lalu kita bertiga bisa langsung pergi ke Selatan. Aku tidak peduli
kalau Huazheng Meizi akan menyalahkanku."

Beberapa puluh _li_ kemudian jejak itu tiba-tiba berbelok ke utara, dan ada jejak manusia di sisi jejak kuda.
Jejak kaki itu begitu aneh, karena jarak antara kedua kaki sekitar empat kaki, dan lagi ukurannya besar, tapi 
tercetak dengan ringan di atas salju, hanya sedalam beberapa inci. Guo Jing terkejut. "Qing Gong orang ini sangat
tinggi." Dengan segera ia teringat sesuatu. "Tidak ada orang lain kecuali Ouyang Feng yang punya kemampuan seperti 
ini. Apa dia mengejar Rong'er?" Berpikir begini, meskipun angin dingin menerpa tapi tanpa sadar sekujur tubuhnya 
berkeringa. Kuda merah kecil itu sangat pintar, entah bagaimana ia tahu majikannya sedang cemas, maka tanpa harus 
menunggu sampai Guo Jing menarik tali kekangnya, ia pun segera berlari mengikuti jejak itu.

Guo Jing melihat jejak kaki itu selalu berada di sebelah jejak kuda. Bebepara _li_ kemudian kedua jejak manusia dan 
kuda itu tiba-tiba berbelok ke arah barat, lalu berbelok lagi ke selatan, terus berbelok dan berputar, tak satu 
bagian pun lurus. Guo Jing berpikir, "Rong'er pasti tahu Ouyang Feng sedang mengejarnya, jadi dia berusaha 
membuat Ouyang feng bingung. Tapi jejak itu tercetak jelas di salju, sama sekali tidak sulit bagi Racun Tua
untuk mengikutinya."

Beberapa puluh _li_ berikutnya jejak manusia dan kuda itu tampak saling mengacaukan, keduanya tumpang-tindih 
dengan jejak kaki manusia dan kuda yang lain lagi. Guo Jing turun dari kuda untuk mengamatinya dari dekat. Ia bisa
mengenali mana jejak yang tercetak lebih dulu dan mana yang belakangan. Melihat bahwa jejak-jejak itu terentang
jauh di atas salju, ia tiba-tiba menyadari sesuatu. "Rong'er pasti menggunakan Qi Men Shi Shu ajaran ayahnya, dengan
sengaja berputar-putar untuk membingungkan Ouyang Feng. Begitu Ouyang Feng kehilangan arah, dia langsung kembali ke 
tujuan semula."

Ia kembali bangkit berdiri, hatinya gembira dan sekaligus cemas. Gembira karena tahu kemungkinan besar Ouyang Feng
tidak akan bisa mengejar Huang Rong, cemas karena jejak-jejak yang membingungkan itu juga membuatnya kehilangan
arah. Berdiri di atas salju ia berpikir, "Rong'er berputar-putar, tapi akhirnya dia pasti akan tetap ke selatan.
Kalau begitu aku harus mengejar ke arah selatan." Melompat ke atas kudanya, ia memandang langit untuk mencari arah,
lalu ia berkuda ke selatan.

Setelah berpacu beberapa waktu, jejak kuda benar-benar muncul kembali. Ia melihat dari kejauhan, di mana langit biru
bertemu dengan putihnya salju, ada bayangan seorang manusia. Guo Jing mengajak kudanya berpacu lebih cepat dan melihat
bahwa orang itu sungguh adalah Ouyang Feng. Saat itu Ouyang Feng juga mengenali Guo Jing, ia memanggil, "Cepat, cepat!
Nona Huang jatuh ke pasir hisap." Guo Jing terkejut, kakinya menjepit kudanya, dan kuda merah itu melesat laksana
anak panah terlepas dari busurnya.

Ketika masih sekitar selusin _zhang_ dari tempat Ouyang Feng berdiri, Guo Jing tiba-tiba merasa kaki kudanya 
tidak menginjak tanah padat, seolah-olah di bawah lapisan salju itu adalah sebuah rawa. Kuda merah kecil itu
juga merasa sedang menginjak tanah yang lunak, buru-buru ia menarik kakinya dan melesat ke depan. Guo Jing membawa
kudanya dalam sebuah lingkaran besar dan kembali lagi, dan melihat Ouyang feng terus-menerus berlari di sekeliling
pohon kecil.

"Apa dia sedang melakukan semacam ilmu sihir?" pikir Guo Jing heran. Ia menarik tali kekang karena ingin menanyakan
sesuatu, tak disangka kuda merahnya tidak mau berhenti, malah mempercepat lajunya dan berputar kembali. Guo Jing 
segera menyadari. "Ternyata di bawah salju ini adalah sebuah rawa lumpur yang lunak, kita akan segera tenggelam begitu
aku berhenti." Tapi kemudian ia merasa seolah-olah darahnya membeku. "Mungkinkah Rong'er terjatuh ke dalam rawa ini?"

"Mana Nona Huang?" panggil Guo Jing.

Ouyang Feng tidak berhenti berlari, ia berteriak, "Aku mengikuti jejak kudanya sampai di sini, lalu tiba-tiba 
menghilang. Lihat!" Sambil bicara jarinya menuding pohon besar itu.

Guo Jing melaju melewati pohon itu di atas kuda, ia melihat sebuah cincin kuning terang di atas sebuah ranting.
Ia mendekatkan kudanya ke arah pohon itu, mengulurkan tangannya dan menangkap cincin itu. Itu ternyata cincin
emas yang biasa dikenakan Huang Rong di rambutnya. Jantungnya hampir melompat dari tenggorokannya.

**——Batas Saduran——**

He turned his horse’s head toward the east. Several ‘li’s later he saw something glitter-
ing on the snow ahead. Bending his body, hanging from the horseback he stretched his
arm out and scooped that thing. It was the flower-patterned gold inlaid pearl head or-
nament that Huang Rong often wore. Guo Jing was very anxious, “Rong’er, Rong’er,
where are you?” he shouted at the top of his lungs. He looked around as far as his eyes
could see, but there was not a single movement on the vast and boundless white plain.

He went several ‘li’s further, toward his left he saw a black sable fur coat lying on the
snowy ground. It was his own coat that he gave to Huang Rong when they first met at
Zhangjiakou [Kalgan?]. He made the little red horse circle around the coat, while shout-
ing loudly, “Rong’er!” His voice traveled far on the open snowy plain. There was no hill
or mountain around, therefore, there was no echo answering his call. Guo Jing was ex-
tremely anxious, he wanted to cry but no sound was coming out from his throat.

A moment later Ouyang Feng arrived, “Let me rest on your horseback, then we will
seek Miss Huang together,” he said.

Guo Jing was indignant, “If you did not chase her, how could she fall into this marsh?”
he scolded. Squeezing his legs he made his little red horse leap forward.

Ouyang Feng was angry, he leaped forward, and in three jumps he had already behind
the horse, stretching his hand to grab the horse’s tail.

Guo Jing did not expect him to come this quick, with a ‘Divine Dragon Swings Its Tail’
his right palm shot backward, crashing Ouyang Feng’s palm, both people were using
their full strength. Guo Jing was blown by Ouyang Feng’s palm strength, his body flew
from his saddle. Fortunately his red horse dashed forward; he stretched his left hand,
grabbing the horse’s buttocks, and swinging his body forward he was back on his sad-
dle in no time.

Ouyang Feng, on the other hand, was pushed two steps backwards. Because of Guo
Jing’s palm strength he landed heavily; his left leg unexpectedly fell deeply into the
mud, straight to his knee. Ouyang Feng was totally shocked; he knew on this kind of
quicksand, as soon as he exerted his strength and tried to jump out, his right foot would
also fall into the mud. Once both legs were in, it did not matter if his skill was as high as
the sky, he would have a very difficult time pulling his own body out of the mud. In des-
peration he laid his body horizontally on the ground, then rolled around while at the
same time kicked his right leg to the air. Using ‘lian huan yuan yang tui’ [chain man-
darin duck’s leg] he borrowed the strength from his right kick to lift his left foot. Mud
splashed everywhere, but his legs were free.

He turned over and stood up, only to hear Guo Jing’s loud calls, “Rong’er! Rong’er!” The
man on the horse had left him for more than a ‘li’. He saw the little red horse was run-
ning steadily; apparently they were already out of the marsh area. Ouyang Feng de-
cided to pursue, but the further he ran, the more he felt the ground underneath his feet
was getting softer; as if he was at the edge of the marsh and now he had treaded into
the center of it.

Three times had Ouyang Feng fallen under Guo Jing’s hands; the last time he was
forced to be naked in front of hundreds of thousands people. It was an extremely dan-
gerous situation; other people might admire his martial art skill, but he actually
thought that was his greatest disgrace. This time he met Guo Jing again, alone. Good or
bad he simply had to seek revenge. Even though the terrain was dangerous, he simply
could not let this good opportunity pass. Much less Huang Rong’s life or death was still
unknown; he could not give up in light of this, no way; therefore, in his anger he de-
cided to pursue Guo Jing.

Displaying his excellent lightness kungfu; in just several ‘li’s he had reached the speed
of a fast horse. Guo Jing heard footsteps on the snow behind him; he turned his head
quickly only to see Ouyang Feng was only several ‘zhang’s behind his horse’s tail. He
was startled, hastily urged his horse to run faster. In just a short moment they have
covered more than a dozen ‘li’s.

Guo Jing did stop calling, “Rong’er!” but he saw the sky was getting darker; Huang
Rong’s fate was increasingly uncertain. His voice was hoarse from shouting, his occa-
sional choke turned into sobs. The little red horse understood the danger they were on
from the start, as it felt softer ground underneath, it ran even faster; eventually its four
hooves moved so fast as if they were flying above the snow.

‘Han xue bao ma’ [precious horse with blood-like sweats] was a rare animal capable of
running very fast; but Ouyang Feng’s lightness kungfu was not inferior. Unfortunately
he was getting tired, after running for a long time his breathing was getting heavier, his
legs’ strength diminished, his footsteps gradually slowing down. Little red horse was
also sweating profusely; beads of red sweats trickled down from its body, splashing to
the white snow below, next to its hoof tracks, like cherry blossom in full bloom.

By the time the sky was completely dark the little red horse had completely left the
marsh; early on Ouyang Feng had disappeared without a trace. Guo Jing thought, “The
horse Rong’er was riding did not have this kind of divine speed; it wouldn’t run for half
a li into the marsh without falling into the mud below. Even if I have to lose my life I
must try to rescue her.” He very well realized that Huang Rong had been missing for a
very long time; if she did fall into the marsh, even if he could pull her out, he would not
be able to bring her back to life. So his motivation was really for his own peace of mind.

Guo Jing dismounted his horse to give it a rest; caressing his horse’s back he said, “Little
horse, oh little horse, today I am asking you not to be afraid of exhaustion. Let’s take a
short rest and then we’ll go again.”

Guo Jing leaped back to his saddle and pulled the rein to turn the horse’ head. The little
red horse was afraid to tread back into the marsh, but Guo Jing kept urging it to go.
Finally with a loud neigh the horse’s four hooves splashed back into the marsh. The
horse knew their destination was still far away, so it ran with all its might, faster and
faster into the marsh.

Suddenly they heard Ouyang Feng’s desperate cry, “Help! Help!” Guo Jing sped his
horse up. Under the glimmering reflection of the white snow he saw Ouyang Feng had
fallen into the mud. His hands were high in the air, flailing chaotically. The mud was
slowly rising, it already reached his chest. As soon as it reached his mouth and nose, he
would certainly be suffocated to death.

Guo Jing could see his desperate situation; he recalled Huang Rong might face similar
danger. His blood boiled inside his chest; he almost dismounted his horse and fell into
the same trap; but decided against doing so at the last minute.

“Quick, help me!” Ouyang Feng cried out.

Guo Jing gritted his teeth and said, “You killed my benevolent masters, you also killed
Miss Huang; do you still want me to save you? Dream on!”

With a stern voice Ouyang Feng replied, “We had made an agreement, you have to
spare my life three times. This is the third time. Are you saying you don’t give a thought
to the good faith?”

With tears in his eyes Guo Jing said, “Miss Huang is no longer alive, what use is our
agreement?”

Ouyang Feng shouted curse and abusive words, but Guo Jing simply ignored him; he
rode his horse away. Only a dozen ‘zhang’s later he heard Ouyang Feng’s pitiful cry. Guo
Jing could not bear it anymore. He heaved a sigh and turned his horse around. The
mud had already reached Ouyang Feng’s neck. “I am willing to save you, but if both of
us ride on this horse, we will sink into the mud together,” he said.

“Use a rope to tow me,” Ouyang Feng suggested. Guo Jing did not carry any rope, but he
remembered his long robe. Grabbing one end, he let his horse ran close to Ouyang
Feng. Ouyang Feng held out his hand and grabbed the other end. Guo Jing squeezed his
legs and gave a loud shout. The little red horse furiously charged forward and with a
loud splashing sound Ouyang Feng was pulled out of the mire and dragged along on the
snowy ground.

If they were heading east, very soon they were going to leave the marsh area; but Guo
Jing was very anxious over Huang Rong, how would he be willing to give up searching
for her? Therefore, they were galloping to the west. Ouyang Feng was still holding on to
the robe, he laid down facing up, being dragged rapidly on the snow. He used this op-
portunity to catch his breath.

The little red horse ran very fast, before daybreak they had crossed the marsh. Guo Jing
saw horse’s track on the snow; it was Huang Rong’s horse entering the marsh area. The
track was still there, but what about Huang Rong? Guo Jing dismounted his horse, stood
on the snow, lost in thought.

In his grief he had completely forgotten his archenemy; he stood with his left hand
holding the rein, and his right hand holding the fur coat, his eyes gazing into the dis-
tance, his heart was shaken, beating rapidly.

Suddenly he felt a light touch on his shoulder. He turned around in shock, only to see
Ouyang Feng’s palm was touching his ‘tao dao’ [pottery way] acupoint. When Ouyang
Feng fell into Guo Jing’s trap and he came out from the sand, Guo Jing had sealed his
‘tao dao’ acupoint. This time Ouyang Feng managed to do the same to Guo Jing, it was a
pay back time; Ouyang Feng could not help but laugh merrily.

Guo Jing was overwhelmed with grief, he had no regard of his life anymore; “If you
want to kill me then just kill me; we don’t have any agreement that you should spare
my life anyway,” he wryly said.

Ouyang Feng was taken aback; he had thought of torturing Guo Jing to disgrace him be-
fore finally taking his life. Who would have thought that Guo Jing did not expect to
live? Ouyang Feng thought, “This dumb kid loves that little girl very much; if I kill him,
then I am helping him fulfilling his desire to die together in the name of love.” He
changed his mind and thought, “That little girl is already buried beneath this snow; he
becomes my only hope of the explanation of the manual.” Grabbing Guo Jing’s arm he
lifted him up and leaped to the horseback. They rode toward a valley in the south.

About the sixth hour [between 9 – 11 am] he saw a village by the roadside. Ouyang
Feng steered the horse to enter the village, but everywhere he looked there were
corpses scattered around the village. Because the weather was cold, the corpses were
preserved; they looked exactly like the day they were mutilated and killed by the pass-
ing Mongolian army. Ouyang Feng called out several times, but nobody answered;
looked like everybody in that village had died. Instead, he heard cattle mooing and
sheep bleating. Ouyang Feng was delighted. He took Guo Jing to a stone house and said,
“You are my prisoner now. I won’t kill you. If you can defeat me, you are free to go.”
Having said that he took a sheep, butchered it, and boiled it in the kitchen.

The more Guo Jing saw his smug expression, the more he hated Ouyang Feng. Ouyang
Feng threw a mutton leg to him and said, “I’ll wait until your stomach is full, then we’ll
fight.”

Guo Jing was angry, “You want to fight then fight. Why wait for the full stomach?” His
body flew, his palm hacked down. Ouyang Feng raised his hand to block then sent out a
fist to counterattack.

Very soon they were fighting inside the stone house, among upturned table and broken
chairs. About thirty stances later Guo Jing had to admit his inferiority; he was half a
step in front of Ouyang Feng when Ouyang Feng’s right palm swung onto his side. It
was very difficult for Guo Jing to fend off, all he could do was to wait for his death.
Unexpectedly Ouyang Feng did not exert any strength; he laughed and said, “It’s
enough for today. You go ahead and train martial art from the manual; tomorrow we’ll
fight again.”

“Bah!” Guo Jing spat; he sat on an overturned chair, picked the mutton leg up and
started to eat. He thought, “He wanted to see me using the martial art from the manual,
so that he might observe and steal it. I won’t be fooled. If he wants to kill me, let him
kill ... Hmm, his swing just now, how would I block it?”

Thinking about all kinds of fist techniques and palm methods in the manual, he could
not find a single move capable of blocking Ouyang Feng’s attack. He did remember,
however, that there was a technique in the manual called ‘fei xu jin’ [flying cotton
strength], which would allow him to strengthen his back and render Ouyang Feng’s at-
tack useless.

“I’d better train internal strength; even if he wants to see it, he can’t,” Guo Jing thought.
Immediately he ate the mutton leg clean then sat cross-legged on the ground; he recited
the manual in his heart then started practicing according to the manual. Since master-
ing the ‘yi jin duan gu pian’ [changing muscle forging bone technique], his foundation
was getting stronger; moreover, with what Reverend Yideng had taught him the
Manual became like a second nature to him. This ‘fei xu jin’ for instance, in less than
four hours he had learned how to use it.

With the corner of his eye he looked at Ouyang Feng, who was also sitting quietly, medi-
tating. “Watch out!” Guo Jing called out. Without standing up his palm hacked down on
the enemy.

Ouyang Feng parried the attack while sending out a counterattack. He wanted to repeat
his earlier stance toward Guo Jing’s side. But to his surprise his palm slid down Guo
Jing’s back, slanting to one side; because of his own strength he was slightly propelled
forward. Taking that opportunity Guo Jing’s left palm shot toward his neck.

Ouyang Feng was startled and pleased at the same time; he continued moving forward
and thus had evaded the attack. He turned around and called out, “Good move! Was it
from the Manual? What is it called?”

“Sha cha yi tui, ai mo qin er,” Guo Jing said.

Ouyang Feng was startled, but then he remembered the weird sentences from the man-
ual. He thought, “This dumb kid has a profound strength, but he is as hardheaded as a
bull. I have to trick him since brute force will be useless.” Changing his tactic he fought
Guo Jing carefully.

Two people fought without ceasing. As soon as Guo Jing lost they would stop, then Guo
Jing would train himself in new stances. Guo Jing slept soundly during the nights, but
Ouyang Feng slept with trepidation; he was afraid Guo Jing might attack him in the
middle of the night, or that he would try to escape in the dark.

They lived like that in the stone house for over a month, and had eaten almost half of
the cattle and sheep in the village. Within this one month Guo Jing was forced to train
his martial art, while Ouyang Feng tried hard to steal it. What Ouyang Feng had
learned was already profound, but when he verified what he saw at Guo Jing, he real-
ized there were many discrepancies; it was very difficult from him to link from one
sentence to the next. The more he pondered, the more he did not understand; and he
could not get anything from Guo Jing. In the meantime, within this month Guo Jing’s
martial art had unexpectedly advanced by leaps and bounds.

Ouyang Feng could not help but secretly anxious, “If we continue like this, before I un-
derstand the essence of the manual, I might not be this dumb kid’s match.”

The first several days Guo Jing was filled with hatred; after every fight he would be
more determined than ever to score a victory, he wanted to master a fierce martial art
to kill his enemy. However, he soon learned that this matter was extremely difficult. He
was not discouraged nonetheless; his anger had decreased somewhat, but his firm reso-
lution had actually increased.

One day he picked a steel sword from among the corpses lying around in the village;
then trained hard on swordsmanship to fight Ouyang Feng’s wooden staff.

Ouyang Feng’s original snake staff fell and was lost in the ocean when he was fighting
Hong Qigong on the boat. Afterwards he made another cast steel staff complete with
new pair of strange snake; but it was also lost when he was trapped inside the ice block,
destroyed by Lu Youjiao. Right now he was using an ordinary wooden staff, without
any assistance from his strange snakes; but his staff technique was still out-of-this-
world, with infinite variations. Several times the staff shook the sword in Guo Jing’s
hand and made it fly. If there were snakes on his staff, definitely Guo Jing would not be
able to resist at all.

In the meantime they heard Genghis Khan’s army returning to the east; the people and
the horses were marching noisily, the noise did not stop for several days. But two peo-
ple were engrossed in fighting each other violently, they did not pay the slightest atten-
tion to this. One evening the noise simply stopped, the army had all gone and nothing
was heard except the quietness of the night.

Guo Jing raised his sword straight up, thinking, “Although I can’t win over you tonight,
your wooden staff won’t shake my sword in any way.” He was anxious to try the new
stance he had just learned, but he waited calmly for the opponent to attack first.
Suddenly from outside the house somebody was shouting loudly, “Traitor! Where are
you running to?” Guo Jing was absolutely certain it was the Old Urchin Zhou Botong’s
voice.

Ouyang Feng and Guo Jing looked at each other in bewilderment, they both thought,
“Why did he go thousands of miles to the west?” They wanted to say something, but
heard footsteps came approaching; then two people, one after another, rushed toward
the stone house. There were numerous other buildings in the village, but apparently
they saw that firelight came from this house.

Ouyang Feng waved his left hand and with his internal strength extinguished the fire.
By that time the front door was shoved open, somebody rushed in, with somebody else
hot on his heels; the latter one was indeed Zhou Botong. Both men’s footsteps were ex-
traordinarily light and nimble; the man in the front’s martial art certainly not below
Zhou Botong’s.

Ouyang Feng marveled greatly, “This man surprisingly able to escape the Old Urchin’s
hand. His skill is very rare among the experts of this generation. If it were Huang
Yaoshi or Hong Qigong, the Old Poison won’t be so surprised.” Because of this thought
he refrained from making any move.

They heard the man in the front jump vertically up and sat on the beam. Zhou Botong
laughed, “The Old Urchin’s favorite game is the hide-and-seek; I won’t let you slip away
anymore.” In the darkness they heard him closing down the front door, and placed a
nearby big rock behind it. He called out, “Stinky thief, where are you?” At the same
time he groped around back and forth to find him.

Guo Jing was thinking of making some noise to tell him the enemy was on the beam,
when suddenly Zhou Botong leaped high while laughing loudly, grabbing that man on
the beam. Turned out he was aware from the start that his enemy was on the beam. He
was deliberately groping around to the east and to the west to throw him off guard,
then suddenly launched a sudden attack.

The man on the beam was not weak either; without waiting for Zhou’s fingers to touch
him he somersaulted and crouched by the north wall. Even though his mouth was bab-
bling nonsense, but Zhou Botong was actually very wary of this man. He stopped to lis-
ten to his exact location; did not dare to act rashly. In the quietness of the night he

heard three distinct breathings. He had known from the start that this house must be
occupied, since he saw the fire was extinguished. But since they did not make any
sound, he thought they must be frightened; thereupon he called out, “Master of the
house please don’t be afraid, I am here to capture this little thief. Once I get him I will
go out immediately.”

He knew ordinary people’s breathing was rough and heavy, while those with strong in-
ternal energy would breathe slowly and long, light and deep; with just a little attention
they were very easy to distinguish. But when he cocked his ears to listen, the people to-
ward his north, east and west were all breathing low and slowly.

Zhou Botong was greatly surprised, “Traitor,” he called out, “You have prepared an am-
bush here!”

Guo Jing wanted to open his mouth to greet him, but changed his mind at the last
minute; he thought, “Ouyang Feng is lurking on the side, the man Zhou Dage [Big
Brother Zhou] is chasing is another powerful enemy. I’d better stay quiet and wait for a
good opportunity to help him.”

Zhou Botong moved step by step toward the front door while mumbling, “Looked like
before the Old Urchin can capture the enemy, he would be captured by the enemy.” He
had made a decision to dash out the door if the situation was unfavorable. Right at that
moment came a rumbling noise from a distance; hoof beats sounded like an evening
tide came crashing the shore. It looked like a strong army with multitude of horses had
arrived to kill.

Zhou Botong called out, “You have more and more helpers coming, the Old Urchin
doesn’t want to play anymore.” While saying that he picked the rock stopping the door
as if he was about to open the door and leave; but then suddenly he hurled the rock to-
ward the man he chased. The rock was not light; Ouyang Feng placed that rock behind
the door every night, so that if Guo Jing wanted to sneak out he would find out even
when he was sleeping.

Ouyang Feng heard the wind carried a lot of strength in it, he thought that when the
Old Urchin threw the stone, his right flank must have been defenseless; if he attacked
him first, not only he would have one less enemy for the present time, but also during
the second Sword Meet of Mount Hua he would have one less powerful contestant.
Having this intention he bent his knee, slightly squatting, pushed both hands together
to launch a ‘Toad Stance’ attack.

He was squatting on the west, therefore, his attack was toward the east, carrying a very
strong energy. Guo Jing had fought him for dozens of days, he knew by heart Ouyang
Feng’s every action and every movement even though the room was pitch black. As
soon as he heard the gust of wind, he knew Ouyang Feng was attacking Zhou Botong.
Guo Jing stepped forward and launched the ‘Proud Dragon Repents’ to meet Ouyang
Feng’s ‘Toad Stance’ head-on.

In the meantime the man who was standing on the north also heard the big rock was
flying his way; he bent his knees to get a stronger stand, and push both hands forward,
creating a strong force striking the big rock.

Four people from four directions sending out four forces; even though they did not re-
lease their energy at exactly the same time, but the forces were actually not inferior
one to another. The big rock was struck by forces from east, south, west and north; it
fell on the center of the room. ‘Crash!’ with a loud noise it broke the table to
smithereens.

The sound was actually very loud; which Zhou Botong thought amusing. He could not
restrain from bursting into loud laughter. But his laughter was drowned by the sound
of thousands of cavalry soldiers entering the village. They could hear the warhorses
neighing, the weapons clashing, and the soldiers shouting their battle cry.

Guo Jing listened to the officers’ commands, and he found out they were the defeated
army of Khoresm entering the village, perhaps trying to hold their ground in the vil-
lage; but it sounded like the Mongolian army had pursued them. He heard the hoof
beats, the sound of battle flag fluttered in the wind, the loud battle cry, as well as flying
arrows near and far. It sounded like the armies were engaged in a close hand-to-hand
combat. The four people in the house did not know for certain how many soldiers were
fighting outside. Suddenly someone shoved the door open and came in. Zhou Botong
grabbed that person and flung him back outside; then he lifted the rock and placed it
back behind the door.

As Ouyang Feng’s attack failed, he thought that he had been discovered anyway, so he
called out, “Old Urchin, do you know who I am?”

Zhou Botong indistinctly heard someone speaking, but because of the noise he could
not distinguish who the speaker was. He raised his left hand to guard against an attack
while stretching his right hand to grab. Ouyang Feng easily neutralized this grab with
his right hand, while slapping with the back of his left hand. Zhou Botong parried this
attack, he was startled, “The Old Poison! You are here?” he called out. He swayed his
body slightly, leaning to the left. At that very moment the man on the north took the op-
portunity to attack Zhou Botong’s back.

Zhou Botong’s right hand engaged Ouyang Feng, while his left fist parried the attack to
his back. He was thinking of testing the mutual hands combat that he created on the
Peach Blossom Island. Until that day Zhou Botong had not tested his special skill against
two masters; so even though he was in danger, he could not let this good opportunity to
pass. But suddenly Guo Jing from the east threw himself into the fight; his right hand
parried Zhou Botong’s fist, while his left hand engaged that person’s attack.

Three people simultaneously called out in alarm; Zhou Botong shouted, “Guo Xiongdi
[Brother Guo],” that person shouted, “Guo Jing,” and Guo Jing himself cried out, “Qiu
Qianren.”

Zhou Botong was scared by the snakes at the martial art contest at the ‘yan yu lou’
[Misty Rain Tavern]; he saw no way to escape, so he laid down on top of the tavern’s
roof, using layers upon layers of split-bamboo sheets to cover up his body. Because his
‘armor’ was so thick no arrow could harm him, Ouyang Feng’s vipers were also help-
less to climb to the roof. When the morning fog was gone, the snakes, as well as the sol-
diers were also gone; so was everybody else, he did not know where they went. He was
bored to death, so he just wandered around everywhere.

A few months later a Beggar Clan disciple delivered a letter to him; it was from Huang
Rong. In the letter Huang Rong reminded him that he had promised no matter what
Huang Rong asked, he would comply. Now Huang Rong wanted him to go kill the Clan
Leader of the Iron Palm Clan, Qiu Qianren. She explained that Emperor Duan’s
Concubine Liu had a very deep enmity against this man; if he killed him, Concubine Liu
would not look for him anymore. Otherwise, Concubine Liu would find him even to the
end of the earth, to take him as her husband. Huang Rong also gave him the detail of
the Iron Palm Peak’s exact location.

Zhou Botong thought that his promise ‘to comply no matter what’ was actually given to
Huang Rong; but that old scoundrel Qiu Qianren colluded with the Jins, he was a
traitor, so he felt it was appropriate to kill him. As for his own affair with Concubine
Liu, he realized he had offended her deeply; she had a deep enmity against Qiu
Qianren, so if he lent her a hand, she might not come and bother him anymore, and
that would be an awfully good luck for him. Therefore, he decided to go to the Iron
Palm Peak.

At first Qiu Qianren was able to match him stance for stance, but as soon as Zhou
Botong used the mutual hands combat technique, Qiu Qianren was forced to withdraw.
When martial art masters contended, as soon as one admit inferiority, then victory or
defeat should be decided; who would have thought that Zhou Botong did not want to
stop and kept chasing him. Qiu Qianren did ask him the reason behind it several times,
but Zhou Botong only looked at him with a blank expression; could not tell him the real
reason. He only said three characters ‘liu gui fei’ [Concubine Liu]; and that would be
enough to take his head.

Two men fought and stop, one ran away the other chased; they went farther and far-
ther away. Zhou Botong’s martial art was slightly superior to Qiu Qianren’s; yet it would
not be easy for him to kill Qiu Qianren. Qiu Qianren had tried any means possible to get
rid of him; but Zhou Botong doggedly chased him anywhere he went. He thought,
“Would you still chase me if I go to the bitter cold west?” On the other hand Zhou
Botong thought, “I want to see where you would go; then I’ll go back home.”

As soon as they arrive at the desert outside the great wall, the landscape was flat, it was
easy to follow someone’s trail; Qiu Qianren did not have any place to hide. Fortunately
Zhou Botong had shown a good faith toward him; whenever Qiu Qianren needed to
sleep or sat down to eat his meal, or perhaps he was having a bowel movement or uri-
nating, Zhou Botong did not disturb him in any way; he simply did the same. But no
matter what Qiu Qianren did, no matter how bad he cursed him, the Old Urchin
haunted him like a ghost, continuously pestering him.

The more Zhou Botong fought Qiu Qianren, the more excited he became. Several times
he did gain an upper hand, but unexpectedly he did not kill Qiu Qianren. That particu-
lar day, two men fought and ran and by a pure coincidence rushed into the stone
building.

Now Zhou and Guo two people knew who the other three people were, but when the
three of them called out each other’s name, their voices were drown by the loud com-
motion outside; hence Ouyang Feng still did not know who the other person was. He
only knew that person was Zhou Botong’s enemy. On the other hand, Qiu Qianren
thought the other two were on the same side.

Zhou, Qiu and Ouyang, all three people possessed outstanding martial art skills; but af-
ter battling Ouyang Feng for more than a month, Guo Jing’s martial art level was also
improving by leaps and bound, which enable him to keep pace with the other three.
These four martial art masters were confined in a pitch-black, approximately two
‘zhang’s square room; they could not see a thing, could not hear each other, and could
not talk to each other. It was as if they had turned into deaf, mute and blind people.

“If I block Ouyang Feng, then Zhou Dage can finish off Qiu Qianren. After that it won’t
be too difficult for us two people to join forces to kill Ouyang Feng,” Guo Jing thought.
Once he reached that decision, his hands started to move. His right hand hit an empty
air, while his left palm met someone else’s hand.

On the Peach Blossom Island Guo Jing had fought Zhou Botong countless of times;
therefore, as soon as his palm touched Zhou’s hand, he knew immediately it was his
Zhou Dage, he retracted his palm quickly. Unexpectedly Zhou Botong’s childlike enthu-
siasm was aroused; he slightly shrank his left arm then sent out a right fist toward Guo
Jing’s shoulder. This hit did not carry any strong internal energy, but since Guo Jing did
not guard against it, he felt pain nonetheless.

“Hao Xiongdi [Good Brother], you want to test your Dage’s martial art? Be careful!”
Zhou Botong said, his left palm shot out. Guo Jing could not hear what he said, but this
time he was prepared; he wielded his arms and neutralized the attack.

By this time Ouyang Feng and Qiu Qianren had also exchanged several stances; as a re-
sult they recognized the opponent by his martial art. These two men did not have any
enmity against each other, but they both thought that the Sword Meet of Mount Hua
was coming. Potentially they were going to fight a life and death battle against each
other anyway; therefore, why not try to inflict as much damage as possible to the oppo-
nent since they have the opportunity now? Hence they did not slack one bit.

After fighting for a moment they felt gusts of wind blowing behind them, to their sur-
prise Zhou Botong was fighting Guo Jing. They were bewildered, but then they remem-
bered Zhou Botong always handled matters differently, he was an unpredictable man;
besides, it gave them a good opportunity, why wouldn’t they be happy? Thus without
prior agreement they both attacked Zhou Botong and Guo Jing.

After exchanging more than a dozen moves with Guo Jing; Zhou Botong found out that
Guo Jing’s martial art was far more advanced than what he had known, he was pleas-
antly surprised. “Xiongdi, where did you learn your martial art from?” he asked. But
the noise outside was deafening, how could Guo Jing hear what he said? Zhou Botong
was offended, “Fine, you don’t want to tell me. Do you think I care?” Right at that mo-
ment he felt a gust of wind on his face, Ouyang and Qiu’s attacks had arrived. Zhou
Botong kicked the ground and leaped up to the beam. “I’ll let you fight these two
alone!” he called out.

Ouyang Feng and Qiu Qianren felt the wind from Zhou Botong’s sleeves, they realized
he had jumped to the beam; they had the same thought of joining forces and kill this
dumb kid, suddenly Guo Jing had to face a converging attack from left and right.

Initially Guo Jing was surrounded by Zhou Botong’s attacks; he had tried four, five dif-
ferent techniques but was unable to free himself. He was waiting for Zhou Botong to
withdraw when two powerful enemies attacked; which forced him to groan inwardly.
He had no choice but braced himself and used the mutual hands combat technique to
resist these two.

After fighting for a while Ouyang Feng and Qiu Qianren were unable to restrain their
amazement. Knowing Guo Jing’s skill, either one of Ouyang Feng or Qiu Qianren should
be able to defeat him easily. Who would have thought that after fighting two against
one, Guo Jing’s left palm could block Ouyang Feng’s attacks, while his right fist
thwarted Qiu’s palms? Two people were helpless against one.

Zhou Botong was sitting on the beam; he had decided to get down, but was afraid Guo
Jing might get hurt, so quietly he slid down the wall, stretching out both his hands arbi-
trarily, and by coincidence caught Ouyang Feng’s back.

Ouyang Feng was squatting on the ground, ready to strike Guo Jing with his fierce Toad
Stance; suddenly he felt somebody on his back, hastily he sent his palms backward.
Guo Jing seized this opportunity to kick Qiu Qianren then leap to the corner of the
house, gasping for breath. If Zhou Botong were one step late, he would be injured by
Ouyang Feng’s attack.

Four people in the pitch-black room clashed to each other then separated from each
other. Sometimes Zhou Botong fought Qiu Qianren, sometimes Guo Jing fought Qiu
Qianren, sometimes Ouyang Feng fought Qiu Qianren, sometimes Zhou Botong fought
Ouyang Feng, and sometimes Guo Jing fought Zhou Botong. Four people engaged in this
mixed-up fight, among them Zhou Botong was most excited; it was the most fun among
all of his fights, of course he would not let this opportunity pass.

After fighting for a while an idea popped up in his head. “My two hands can be consid-
ered two people; Ouyang and Qiu are also two. See if you can fight four people at once.
Have you ever tried this?” he asked Guo Jing.

Guo Jing did not hear what he said, but suddenly felt three people attack him at the
same time; desperately he tried to block and evade. “Don’t be afraid, don’t be afraid,”
Zhou Botong encouraged him, “I will help you if you are in danger.” But in this dark
room, as soon as somebody sent out a fist or a kick, his life would be in grave danger;
how could Zhou Botong have time to help?

A dozen or so stances later Guo Jing was already dead-tired; he felt Ouyang and Qiu,
two people’s fists were getting heavier and heavier, he was forced to step back one step
after another. He wanted to jump up the beam to catch his breath, but Zhou Botong’s
palms did not give him any slack. He was both alarmed and angry, finally he lost his pa-
tience, “Zhou Dage, you silly old man, why do you bother me?” but his words were
drowned by the commotion outside, nobody heard him.

Guo Jing withdrew several more steps, suddenly his feet knocked the big rock on the
ground; he nearly tumbled down. Before he had any chance to straighten up his waist,
Qiu Qianren’s iron palm was ready to slap him down. In this dire situation Guo Jing did
not lose his wit, swiftly he picked the big rock up and held it in front of his chest. Qiu
Qianren’s palm hit the rock. Guo Jing focused his strength on his arms and pushed the
rock forward to meet the attack. Suddenly he felt gust of wind coming from his left;
Ouyang Feng’s palm had arrived. With a loud shout Guo Jing threw the big rock up-
ward, while he jumped sideways to evade the attack.

The big rock flew through the roof; bricks and plasters fell down like rain. Immediately
the stars in the sky above cast a dim light through the hole. Zhou Botong was angry,
“Look what you did! Now we lost all the fun!”

Guo Jing was extremely exhausted; he kicked the ground and jumped out through the
hole. Ouyang Feng hastily flew up to chase him. Zhou Botong shouted, “Don’t go! Don’t
go! Stay here and play with me.” He stretched out his hand to grab Ouyang Feng’s left
foot. Ouyang Feng was startled, quickly his right foot kicked, forcing Zhou Botong’s
hand to let go; but as a result he could not jump and was forced to land back down.

Qiu Qianren did not wait for him to land, he sent out a kick toward Ouyang Feng’s
chest. Ouyang Feng slightly pulled his chest back while stretching out his arm to grab
Qiu Qianren’s ankle. Three people once again engaged in a fierce battle against each
other. This time they could vaguely see each other’s shadow; while the battle noise out-
side was also gradually diminishing. The thrill of the fight decreased substantially.

Zhou Botong was upset, he lost his interest; he vented his disappointment toward these
two people. His fist technique changed abruptly, he fought the two people with murder-
ous intention.

After escaping from the house via the roof, Guo Jing saw the troops and horses running
around swiftly; he could also hear the sound of clashing weapons in a distance.
Oftentimes he heard heart-rending groan and cry of soldiers wounded by blades or ar-
rows. He dashed through these miserable people, running toward a small wood outside
the village to lie down and take some rest.

He had fought fiercely for half a night, as he lay down, he felt his whole body, muscles
and bones were aching, like they were going to crack. Recalling the fight inside that
stone house, he shivered involuntarily. Although worried about Zhou Botong’s safety,
but with his martial art level he knew even if he came back there he would not be able
to help Zhou escape. Finally he closed his eyes and fell into a deep sleep.

Early morning the next day he felt his face was wet and cold, something was wiggling
around on his face. Startled he opened his eyes and leaped up, only to listen to a happy
neighing sound. Turned out it was his little red horse licking his face. Guo Jing was de-
lighted, immediately he hugged the horse’s neck; one man and one horse embraced in a
joyful reunion.

When Guo Jing was held captive by Ouyang Feng, the red horse was let loose outside; it
went grazing on the nearby prairie. During the fierce battle last night the horse utilized
its swift legs to escape. When the soldiers were gone, the horse came back and found its
master.

Guo Jing led the red horse returned to the village only to see broken bows and arrows
everywhere, dead soldiers and horses scattered all around. Here and there he saw in-
jured soldiers who were still alive, crying out pitifully. He had been in a lot of battles,
he was accustomed to dead or wounded soldiers; but recalling his own life experience
he could not refrain from feeling a great sorrow.

Quietly he returned to the stone building. Cocking his ears outside he tried to listen, but
the house was quiet. He took a peek through a crack in the door and saw no one inside.

He pushed the door open to see; but Zhou Botong, Ouyang Feng, and Qiu Qianren three
people had already disappeared without ay trace.
He stared blankly for half a day then mounted his horse heading east. The little red
horse ran very fast, very soon they caught up with Genghis Khan’s main army.

By this time Khoresm cities had either surrendered or been destroyed; hundreds of
thousand warriors had fallen like broken tiles. Khoresm king, Muhammad, was a
haughty tyrant; he was deserted by his friends and allies. He led the remnants of his defeated 
army desperately escape to the west. Genghis Khan assigned his senior generals,
Subotai and Jebeh to lead twenty thousand soldiers to pursue to the west; while he led
the main army went home to the east.

Subotai and Jebeh pursued to the west of modern day city of Moscow, to the city of Kiev
nearby the bank of Dnieper River. They crushed several hundred thousands of Russia
and Kipchak alliance army; destroyed the city of Kiev and killed the Hertog [Grand
Duke] of Kiev along with eleven princes by running a chariot over them. This war was
called ‘The Battle of the Kalka River’. Since then the Russian prairie groaned under the
Mongolian horses’ hoofs.

Muhammad went as far west as he could, finally he escaped to a deserted island on the
Caspian Sea and died of illness there.

When suddenly Guo Jing disappeared at Samarkhand, Genghis Khan was very worried.
He was afraid that Guo Jing somehow got killed in the chaotic battle without anybody
knowing it. Seeing him return safe and sound he was really thrilled. Needless to say,
Princess Huazheng was even more overjoyed.

Qiu Chuji followed the main army went back to the east. Along the way he was always
giving advice to the Great Khan to love the people more and kill innocent civilians less.
Although Genghis Khan did not necessarily agree with his view, he realized the Priest
spoke reasonably, hence he did not argue too much. In the chaotic battles that followed,
Qiu Chuji had succeeded in saving innumerable civilians’ lives.

Khoresm was located tens of thousands of ‘li’s from Mongolia; the return of Genghis
Khan’s army to the east took a very long time. As soon as they arrived back home, he
held a big feast to celebrate their victory by the bank of Onon River; while giving the in-
jured soldiers time to recuperate. Qiu Chuji and his disciples, along with Lu Youjiao and
the rest of the Beggar Clan disciples took their leave and went back to the south.

Several months later Genghis Khan saw his warriors had eaten to their hearts’ con-
tents, their horses galloped freely on the prairie; his interest to attack the south was
rekindled. One day he held a general assembly to discuss strategies to defeat the Jin
country.

Ever since Huang Rong’s death, Guo Jing was broken hearted; oftentimes he went rid-
ing alone with only his little red horse and his pair of eagles to keep him company,
wandering the vast Mongolian prairie. Most of the time he would just stare blankly and
not say anything for a few days. Princess Huazheng was always trying to speak warmly
to him, but it seemed like he did not hear anything she said. Everybody knew his feel-
ings, knew that he was grieving, so nobody dared to bring up the wedding plan; while
Genghis Khan was busy preparing the expedition to the south and did not pay attention
to this matter.

That day at the general assembly inside the Great Khan’s Golden Tent, many generals
proposed various tactics and strategies to attack the south; yet Guo Jing did not utter a
single word.

After dismissing his generals, Genghis Khan went to the top of a small hill and stayed
there for half a day, to think of the actions he would take. The next day he dispatched
his army to attack the Jins from three directions. At that moment his eldest son Jochi
and his second son Chagatai were still busy consolidating their conquests in the west;
therefore, he put the main army to take the Jins down under his third son, Ogedei;
while the left flank was placed under the command of his fourth son, Tuolei, and the
right flank was placed under Guo Jing’s command.
