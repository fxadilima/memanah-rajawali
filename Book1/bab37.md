Para prajurit menggabungkan kekuatan untuk mengangkat es balok itu. Di bawah cahaya obor yang terang mereka melihat Ouyang Feng memamerkan gigi dengan ekspresi marah di wajahnya, tangan dan kakinya terentang lebar. Ia membeku di dalam es balok dan tidak bisa bergerak sedikit pun. Para petugas dan prajurit meledak dalam tepuk tangan meriah._ |

Suatu hari pasukan Guo Jing mendirikan kemah di tepi sungai. Di sore hari Guo Jing sedang membaca buku strategi militer
ketika tiba-tiba terdengar suara ribut-ribut di luar tenda. Tirai yang menutup tendanya terbuka, dan seseorang memaksa masuk.
Para pengawal di luar berteriak-teriak, berusaha menghentikannya, tapi orang itu menggerakkan tangannya dan para pengawal
itu jatuh bergelimpangan di tanah. Orang itu mengangkat kepalanya dan tertawa. Di bawah cahaya lilin Guo Jing bisa 
melihat mukanya dengan jelas, itu tak lain dari Racun Barat Ouyang Feng, yang dicari-cari Guo Jing kesana-kemari sejauh 
puluhan ribu _li_. Secara tak terduga ia muncul di tanah asing ini, Guo Jing terkejut bercampur girang. Ia melompat
dari kursinya dan berseru, "Mana Nona Huang?"

"Aku baru ingin menanyakannya kepadamu," jawab Ouyang Feng. "Mana anak itu? Cepat bawa dia kemari!"

Mendengar hal ini, kegembiraan Guo Jing sungguh tak terkira. "Jadi Rong'er masih hidup, dan bukan hanya itu, dia juga 
bisa melarikan diri dari tangan jahatnya," pikirnya.

"Mana anak itu?" tanya Ouyang Feng lagi dengan nada galak.


“She went with you in Jiangnan, then what happened? She ... is she well? You haven’t
killed her, I really should thank you! I ... I must thank you,” Guo Jing said. He was sob-
bing from overwhelming delight.

Ouyang Feng knew Guo Jing was not able to lie, but all signs indicated that Huang Rong
was with him; how could he be so oblivious, Ouyang Feng had to re-think his assump-
tions. He sat cross-legged on the carpet in Guo Jing’s tent.

Guo Jing wiped out his tears, then unsealed his guards’ acupoints and asked them to de-
liver ‘ru jiu lao cha’ [lit. milk wine cream tea – don’t know exactly what kind of drink it
was].

Ouyang Feng drank a bowl of ‘ma ru jiu’ [horse milk wine], he said, “Dumb kid, I might
as well speak frankly with you. That little girl was with me since we were at the Temple
of the Iron Spear in Jiaxing, unexpectedly several days later she escaped from me.”

Guo Jing cheered ecstatically, he said, “She is so smart, once she decided to escape, she
will find a way to escape. How did she do it?”

Ouyang Feng full of hatred said, “At the Cloud Manor, by Lake Tai ... Bah!” he spat,
“Why would I tell you? In short, she ran away.”

Guo Jing knew Ouyang Feng was a conceited man; he did not expect him to personally
reveal his own setback, so he stopped asking question. Knowing Huang Rong was alive
and well he was elated, he kept shouted, “Wonderful! Just wonderful!”

Ouyang Feng was annoyed, “What do you mean wonderful?” he asked, “After she es-
caped I was hot on her trail; several times I almost caught her, but every time she man-
aged to get away relying on her craftiness. But I always followed her closely, she could
not run away to the Peach Blossom Island. I chased her to the Mongolian border then
suddenly her trail disappeared. I thought she must be hiding in your troops; therefore, I
am standing on my guard to prevent her from running away again.”

Hearing that Huang Rong was in Mongolia, Guo Jing was pleasantly surprised, “Have
you seen her?” he asked.

Ouyang Feng was indignant, “If I saw her, wouldn’t I capture her?” he said, “Day and
night I stayed in your troops keeping my eyes open, I did not even see this little girl’s
shadow. Dumb kid, what kind of crafty trick are you playing?”

Guo Jing was silent for half a day, he asked, “Day and night you are in my troops? How
come I did not recognize you?”

Ouyang Feng smiled, “I am just a lowly western area soldier in your ‘tian qian’ [front
sky] group; you are the commander-in-chief, how would you recognize me?” In the
Mongolian army, there were many prisoners of war who were then given jobs as sol-
diers; Ouyang Feng was from the west, once he intermingled with other soldiers from
the same region, it was really not easy to single him out.

Listening to him Guo Jing was startled, he thought, “If he meant me harm, I would be
dead by now.” He muttered, “Why did you say Rong’er is in my army?”

“You captured the Great Khan’s two sons, you destroyed cities and crushed the enemies,
if not by that little girl’s direction, how can a dumb kid like you accomplish all that?”
Ouyang Feng replied, “But that little girl has never shown herself up; it’s really strange.
I have no choice but forcing you to hand her over to me.”

Guo Jing smiled, “If Rong’er is willing to show herself up that will be my earnest desire.
Just think: would I hand her over to you?”

“Fine,” Ouyang Feng said, “You are not willing to hand her over to me, I’ll find my way
to get hold of her. You have great authority as the commander of tens of thousands sol-
diers, but in Ouyang Feng’s eye, hey, hey ... outside or inside this tent, I can come and go
as I like; who can stop me?”

Guo Jing nodded, silently agreed to what he said.

“Dumb kid, what do you say we make an agreement?” Ouyang Feng asked.

“What agreement?” Guo Jing replied with a question.

Ouyang Feng said, “You tell me her hiding place, I guarantee not to harm even a single
strand of her hair. But if you don’t want to tell me, I will find her sooner or later any-
way. When that time comes, humph, it doesn’t matter anymore, does it?”

Guo Jing knew Ouyang Feng was smart and resourceful; as long as Huang Rong was not
on the Peach Blossom Island, there would come a day when she would be captured by
him. Ouyang Feng was not making an empty threat. He hesitated for a moment before
finally saying, “All right, I am going to make an agreement with you, but not like what
you said.”

“What do you mean?” Ouyang Feng asked.

“Mr. Ouyang,” Guo Jing said, “Your martial art is a lot higher than mine, but I am a lot
younger than you are. One day you will grow old and your strength will be gone; you
won’t be able to defeat me anymore.” Before, Guo Jing always called him ‘Uncle
Ouyang’ but since he killed Guo Jing’s five benevolent masters, Guo Jing’s hatred was as
deep as the ocean; therefore, he could not say the word ‘Uncle’ anymore.

It never occurred to Ouyang Feng that someday he would grow old and lose his
strength; this revelation send a chill to his heart, “What this dumb said is actually not
dumb at all,” he thought. “What then?” he asked.

“There is very deep enmity between us,” Guo Jing said, “I can’t leave this enmity un-
avenged. Even if you fly to the sky, there will come a day when I will come looking for
you.”

Ouyang Feng lifted up his head and laughed loudly, “Before I grow old and lose my
strength, I will kill you!” As soon as he finished talking he bent his knees slightly, and
thrust both palms forward with an earth-shattering force.

By this time Guo Jing had mastered the ‘yi jin duan gu pian’ [changing muscle forging
bone] from the Nine Yin Manual. Also he had trained himself in the part that Reverend
Yideng had translated; his internal energy had enjoyed quite a bit of improvement. He
leaned his body slightly to avoid the attack, and at the same time counterattack with
‘jian long zai tian’ [seeing dragon in the field].

Ouyang Feng received Guo Jing’s attack head-on, thinking that he was already familiar
with this ’18-Dragon Subduing Palms’. Besides, Guo Jing was Hong Qigong’s disciple, so
his strength should be a lot less than Hong Qigong. Hence, he did not put too much en-
ergy on his defense. But unexpectedly when their palms met he was shaken. If his in-
ternal energy was not strong enough, he would be seriously injured. He was being care-
less and nearly lost in Guo Jing’s hand. He was shocked, “Perhaps this kid will already
catch up with me before I grow old and lose my strength” he thought. Quickly he sent
his left palm out.

Guo Jing again leaned sideways to evade, then returned the attack. This time Ouyang
Feng did not dare to take it head on, he flicked his hand to redirect Guo Jing’s palm. Guo
Jing did not know Ouyang Feng’s real intention, he thought Ouyang Feng simply par-
ried his attack, who would have thought that inside that defensive move there was a
hidden attack; Guo Jing felt a strong force surging toward his face, there was not
enough time to evade, so he was forced to stretch out his right palm to block.

Speaking about internal energy strength, Guo Jing was still one level inferior to Ouyang
Feng. The current situation was similar to the day at the imperial palace in Lin’an, in-
side the cave behind the waterfall; although Guo Jing would be able to hold his ground
for a while, but in the end he would suffer a heavy injury or even death.

Ouyang Feng’s movement resembled a gourd, enticing the opponent to enter; which
Guo Jing did. Ouyang Feng was delighted, but suddenly sensed Guo Jing pulled his right
palm slightly, like he was losing his strength. Ouyang Feng sent more force to his palm,
pressing harder; who would have thought that Guo Jing’s palm slid a little bit and thus
avoid being crushed.

Ouyang Feng grunted ferociously, sending all his strength to his palm, thinking, “Today
is the day you are going to die.”

Seeing the opponent’s fingertip swept to his chest, Guo Jing parried by sweeping his left
palm horizontally while his right-hand index finger stretched out and fiercely went to
Ouyang Feng’s ‘tai yang’ [sun] acupoint. It was the ‘Solitary Yang Finger’ he saw
Reverend Yideng used. However, what he learned was superficial, he only saw the
form, but did not know the variations within. In this critical moment instinctively he
used mutual hands combat technique.

‘Solitary Yang Finger’ was the ‘Toad Stance’s adversary, how could Ouyang Feng not
startled when he saw it? He leaped backward to elude, shouted angrily, “Old Duan
Zhixing wants to give me a hard time?”

Unfortunately Guo Jing’s finger technique was not the real ‘Solitary Yang Finger’, hence
it could not break the Toad Stance; but Ouyang Feng was scared away, without looking
clearly he jumped back in shock. Only afterwards did he remember that the Solitary
Yang Finger had an infinite variations; how could after launching an attack Guo Jing re-
tracted his finger? Hence he knew Guo Jing had not learned it in its entirety. Without
waiting for Guo Jing to launch the next stance both of his palms, one upward the other
downward, one attack the other guarded, moved toward Guo Jing. This attack was so
swift that Guo Jing did not have time to think, he simply jumped back to escape. ‘Crack!’
the small table behind him was smashed by the Western Poison’s palms.

Since he was gaining an upper hand, Ouyang Feng continued his attack by successively
sending his palms; but suddenly he felt a gust of wind coming from behind, somebody
attacked him. Without turning around he sent his left foot kicking backward. Turned
out the attacker was also using his leg, so two legs collided, the attacker was thrown
backward; luckily his bone was not broken, it looked like he had anticipated Ouyang
Feng’s counterattack.
