Pada saat itu Guo Jing dan Huang Rong sedang menikmati kebahagiaan dan sukacita di hati mereka, mereka tidak mau
peduli pada urusan orang lain. Tetapi ketika mendengar 'Bocah Tua Nakal' hati mereka terusik. Mereka melompat 
bersamaan dan mengejar kedua orang itu. Kungfu kedua orang itu tampak biasa saja, mereka bahkan sama sekali tidak 
curiga bahwa mereka sedang dibuntuti orang. Meninggalkan kota mereka berlari sekitar lima-enam _li_ sebelum berbelok 
ke arah sebuah lembah. Mereka mendengar suara teriakan dan kutukan terus-menerus datang dari balik gunung itu.

Guo Jing dan Huang Rong mempercepat langkah dan ikut masuk ke dalam lembah. Mereka melihat sekelompok orang sedang 
berkumpul di suatu lapangan. Dua orang dari mereka memegang obor di tangan. Di tengah lapangan itu Zhou Botong sedang 
duduk diam tak bergerak. Tidak jelas ia masih hidup atau sudah mati. Di hadapan Zhou Botong ada seseorang yang juga duduk
bersila, mengenakan kasaya merah, itu ternyata Lingzhi Shangren. Ia juga tak bergerak. Di sebelah kiri Zhou Botong ada 
sebuah gua. Jalan masuknya kecil, karena itu orang yang ingin mausk harus membungkuk. Di luar gua itu ada lima-enam orang 
yang sedang memaki dan berteriak, tetapi tak seorang pun berani mendekat dalam jarak satu _zhang_ dari gua, seolah-olah 
mereka takut ada sesuatu yang akan keluar dari situ untuk mencelakai mereka.

Guo Jing teringat salah satu pejalan kaki itu berkata, "Bocah Tua Nakal jatuh ke perangkap Saudara Peng." dan sekarang 
ia melihat Zhou Botong duduk tak bergerak seperti mayat. Ia kuatir Zhou Botong terluka, ia jadi cemas dan hendak melompat 
maju ketika Huang Rong menarik tangannya dan berbisik, "Sebelum melakukan sesuatu, kita selidiki dulu apa yang sebenarnya 
terjadi."


Two people hid behind a mountain rock and looked at the people outside the cave. It
turned out they were all old acquaintances: Shen Xian Lao Guai [Ginseng Immortal Old
Freak] Liang Ziweng, Gui Men Long Wang [Dragon King of Guimen (lit. ghost gate)] Sha
Tongtian, Qian Shou Ren Tu [Thousand Hands Butcher] Peng Lianhu, San Tou Jiao
[Three Headed Scaly Dragon] Hou Tonghai, plus the two night-walkers they followed
earlier. The light from the torches illuminated their faces and Jing and Rong recognized
those two as Liang Ziweng’s disciples; Guo Jing had fought them the first time he
learned the Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms.

Huang Rong thought that now these people were not Guo Jing’s and her matches; she
looked to all directions but did not see anybody else. With a low voice she said, “With
the Old Urchin’s skill, how could these several fellows defeat him? It seems like the
Western Poison Ouyang Feng is lurking somewhere.”

She was about to think of a way to investigate further when Peng Lianhu shouted loud
and clear, “Thief male servant bird! [I know this one sounds weird, but it is the literal
translation. I’ll leave it to the editors to find a more suitable curse words ... J] If you
don’t come out, Old Man here will smoke you out!”

From the cave came a stern voice, “Whatever stinky tricks you have; bring it on!”

Guo Jing recognized it was his Da Shifu [First Master] Ke Zhen’e’s voice; he did not care
if Ouyang Feng was lurking around somewhere. “Shifu!” he shouted, “Your disciple Guo
Jing is here!” His hands had already made some moves while he was still shouting. He
grabbed Hou Tonghai’s back and flung him aside.

The people outside the cave were thrown into confusion. Sha Tongtian and Peng
Lianhu made a simultaneous attack. Liang Ziweng turned around Guo Jing’s back,
ready to make a sneak attack. Ke Zhen’Einside the cave heard everything; he raised his
hand and launched a ‘du ling’ [poisonous water caltrop] toward Liang Ziweng’s back.

The projectile carried a fierce gust of wind. Liang Ziweng hastily lowered his head; the
‘du ling’ flew over his head, cutting several strands of his hair. He was so shocked that
cold sweats trickled down his back. He knew Ke Zhen’e’s secret projectiles contained a
violent poison on it; the other day Peng Lianhu nearly got killed under this weapon.
Hastily he leaped back several ‘zhang’s, stretched out his hand to feel the top of his
head. Luckily his scalp was not injured. Straightaway he took some ‘tou gu ding’ [Bone
Penetrating Nails] from his pocket and walked quietly toward the left of the cave; he
wanted to enter the cave to extract his revenge.

He was just about to raise his hand when suddenly his wrist was numb; something hit
his hand. With a clanking noise the ‘tou gu ding’ fell to the ground. And then he heard a
female voice said with a laugh, “Kneel down! Or you’ll eat my stick!”

Liang Ziweng quickly turned his head and saw Huang Rong stood smiling, with a bam-
boo stick in her hand. He was scared and angry at the same time; his left palm struck
toward her shoulder, his right hand tried to grab the bamboo stick. Huang Rong
stepped aside to evade his left palm, but did not move the bamboo stick, she let him to
have a good grip on it. Liang Ziweng was delighted, he held out his hand, thinking that
if this young girl did not let go, he would snatch the stick away. As soon as he pulled, he
did indeed manage to pull the bamboo stick away, but unexpectedly the end of the stick
shook and slid right out of his palm. By this time the end of the bamboo stick had en-
tered his circle of defense. His hands were so close to the stick that he hurriedly
reached back to grab; but he was too late. A dark green shadow flashed and ‘slap!’ his
head was squarely hit by the bamboo stick.

Overall his martial art skill was not weak; in this critical moment he was still able to
throw himself to the ground and he rolled away more than a ‘zhang’ away before he
sprang back up. He looked with a shocked expression at this young girl with bright eyes
and ivory teeth. The top of his head was hurting, his mind was confused, and his face
looked awkward.

Huang Rong said with a laugh, “Do you know the name of this stick method? You have
been beaten by me, so what did you turn into?”

Liang Ziweng had suffered hardship under this Dog Beating Stick Technique in the
past; he was beaten half dead and half alive under Hong Qigong’s hands. It had been
several years since then, but he still had a lingering fear in his heart. He noticed that
the stick was indeed Hong Qigong’s Dog Beating Stick, and the stick method was indeed
Hong Qigong’s Dog Beating Stick Technique, used up against him. It looked like this
young girl was truly Hong Qigong’s heir. With the corner of his eyes he saw Sha and
Peng two people continuously step back under the power of Guo Jing’s palms without
being able to counterattack; he called out, “In honor of the Old Hong Bangzhu [Clan
Leader Hong] we’d better go!” He called out his two disciples and turned around to flee.

Guo Jing’s left elbow circled around forcing Sha Tongtian to retreat three steps; fol-
lowed by the sweep of his left hand. Peng Lianhu saw that this palm carried a strong
gust of wind, he did not dare to take it head-on, he hastily stepped aside to evade. Guo
Jing’s right hand made a hook, grabbed his back and lifted him up.

Peng Lianhu was rather short, being lifted high in the air his legs were kicking around
frantically. He tried to hit and kick to free himself, but he did not have any strength left.
He saw Guo Jing’s left hand make a fist, ready to strike his chest like a hammer pound-
ing a nail; how could he endure this strike? He hastily shouted, “What date is today?”

“What?” Guo Jing was startled.

“Are you going to keep a good faith? Do you stay true to your own promise?” Peng
Lianhu asked.

“What?” Guo Jing asked again; his right hand was still holding Peng Lianhu high in the
air.

“We have agreed to have a martial art contest in Jiaxing on the fifteenth of the eighth
month, at the Misty Rain Tavern,” Peng Lianhu said, “We are not in Jiaxing, and today is
not the Mid-autumn Festival. How can you injure me?”

Guo Jing thought he was right; he was about to release him when suddenly he remem-
bered something. “What did you do to my Zhou Dage [big brother Zhou]?”

Peng Lianhu replied, “The Old Urchin is betting against that Tibetan monk; whoever
moves first lose. What does it have to do with me?”

Guo Jing cast a glance toward the two people sitting on the ground, he felt relieved. “So
that’s how it is,” he thought. Then he shouted, “Da Shifu [first master], are you Senior
well?” Ke Zhen’Eonly uttered an ‘Hm’ sound from inside the cave.

Guo Jing was afraid as soon as he let Peng Lianhu go, he would kick him on the chest;
hence with his right hand he flung Peng Lianhu several feet away, while calling out,
“Off you go!”

Peng Lianhu took that opportunity to somersault and land on the ground. He saw Sha
Tongtian and Liang Ziweng had already run away. He inwardly scolded them for not
remembering their friend. He cupped his fists toward Guo Jing and said, “Seven days
later at Misty Rain Tavern we will decide victory and defeat.” He turned around and
displaying his ‘qing gong’ [lightness kungfu] he ran away. He was wondering about one
thing, “Each time I meet this kid, his martial art is improving by leaps and bounds. Isn’t
that strange? Did he eat some magic pills or find some immortal secret?”
