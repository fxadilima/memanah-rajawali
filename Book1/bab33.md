**WARNING: These are drafts**

Pada saat itu Guo Jing dan Huang Rong sedang menikmati kebahagiaan dan sukacita di hati mereka, mereka tidak mau
peduli pada urusan orang lain. Tetapi ketika mendengar 'Bocah Tua Nakal' hati mereka terusik. Mereka melompat 
bersamaan dan mengejar kedua orang itu. Kungfu kedua orang itu tampak biasa saja, mereka bahkan sama sekali tidak 
curiga bahwa mereka sedang dibuntuti orang. Meninggalkan kota mereka berlari sekitar lima-enam _li_ sebelum berbelok 
ke arah sebuah lembah. Mereka mendengar suara teriakan dan kutukan terus-menerus datang dari balik gunung itu.

Guo Jing dan Huang Rong mempercepat langkah dan ikut masuk ke dalam lembah. Mereka melihat sekelompok orang sedang 
berkumpul di suatu lapangan. Dua orang dari mereka memegang obor di tangan. Di tengah lapangan itu Zhou Botong sedang 
duduk diam tak bergerak. Tidak jelas ia masih hidup atau sudah mati. Di hadapan Zhou Botong ada seseorang yang juga duduk
bersila, mengenakan kasaya merah, itu ternyata Lingzhi Shangren. Ia juga tak bergerak. Di sebelah kiri Zhou Botong ada 
sebuah gua. Jalan masuknya kecil, karena itu orang yang ingin masuk harus membungkuk. Di luar gua itu ada lima-enam orang 
yang sedang memaki dan berteriak, tetapi tak seorang pun berani mendekat dalam jarak satu _zhang_ dari gua, seolah-olah 
mereka takut ada sesuatu yang akan keluar dari situ untuk mencelakai mereka.

Guo Jing teringat salah satu pejalan kaki itu berkata, "Bocah Tua Nakal jatuh ke perangkap Saudara Peng." dan sekarang 
ia melihat Zhou Botong duduk tak bergerak seperti mayat. Ia kuatir Zhou Botong terluka, ia jadi cemas dan hendak melompat 
maju ketika Huang Rong menarik tangannya dan berbisik, "Sebelum melakukan sesuatu, kita selidiki dulu apa yang sebenarnya 
terjadi."

Keduanya bersembunyi di balik batu gunung dan mengawasi orang-orang di luar gua. Ternyata semuanya adalah kenalan lama,
Shen Xian Lao Guai Liang Ziweng, Guo Men Long Wang Sha Tongtian, Qian Shou Ren Tu Peng Lianhu, San Tou Jiao Hou Tonghai,
ditambah dengan kedua pejalan kaki yang mereka ikuti sebelumnya. Penerangan dari obor menerangi wajah-wajah mereka,
Guo Jing dan Huang Rong mengenali kedua orang itu sebagai dua murid Liang Ziweng. Guo Jing pernah bertarung dengan 
mereka ketika pertama kalinya ia mempelajari Delapan Belas Jurus Penakluk Naga.

Huang Rong berpikir bahwa sekarang orang-orang ini bukan tandingan Guo Jing, bahkan juga bukan tandingan dirinya, ia 
memandang ke sekeliling dan tidak menemukan ada orang lain di situ. Dengan suara rendah ia berkata, "Dengan ilmu 
Lao Wantong, masa beberapa orang ini bisa mengalahkan dia? Kelihatannya Si Racun Barat Ouyang Feng bersembunyi entah 
di mana."

Ia baru hendak memikirkan cara untuk menyelidikinya lebih lanjut ketika Peng Lianhu berseru dengan suara nyaring 
dan jernih, "Tua bangka! Kalau kau tidak mau keluar, Laofu akan mengasapimu!"

Dari dalam gua terdengar suara tegas, "Akal bulus macam apa pun itu, lakukan saja!"

Guo Jing mengenalinya sebagai suara guru pertamanya, Ke Zhen'E, ia tidak peduli lagi apakah ada Ouyang Feng di sekitar
situ. "Shifu!" serunya. "Muridmu Guo Jing ada di sini!" Tangannya sudah bergerak sementara ia masih berteriak. Ia mencekal 
punggung Hou Tonghai dan melemparkannya ke samping.

Orang-orang di luar gua itu kebingungan. Sha Tongtian dan Peng Lianhu menyerang serempak. Liang Ziweng menyelinap ke 
belakang Guo Jing, bersiap melakukan serangan mendadak. Ke Zhen'E di dalam gua mendengar semuanya, ia mengangkat tangannya
dan menyerang dengan Du Ling[^du-ling] ke arah punggung Liang Ziweng.

[^du-ling]: Du Ling adalah sejenis kacang air yang beracun, senjata rahasia andalan Ke Zhen'E.

Senjata rahasia itu membawa serta hembusan angin dahsyat. Liang Ziweng buru-buru menundukkan kepala, Du Ling itu 
terbang melewati kepalanya, memotong beberapa helai rambutnya. Ia begitu kaget sampai keringat menitik di punggungnya.
Ia tahu senjata rahasia Ke Zhen'E mengandung racun ganas, sebelumnya Peng Lianhu nyaris tewas terkena senjata itu.
Ia buru-buru melompat mundur beberapa _zhang_, mengulurkan tangannya dan meraba bagian atas kepalanya. Untungnya kulit 
kepalanya tidak terluka. Dengan segera ia mengambil beberapa batang Jarum Penembus Tulang dari sakunya dan berjalan diam-diam
ke arah sebelah kiri gua. Ia ingin memasuki gua untuk membalas.

Ia baru bermaksud mengangkat tangannya ketika mendadak pergelangan tangannya mati rasa, sesuatu telah menghantam tangannya.
Dengan suara berdenting jarum-jarumnya berjatuhan ke tanah. Dan kemudian ia mendengar suara perempuan berkata sambil 
tertawa, "Berlutut! Atau kau akan makan tongkatku!"

Liang Ziweng memalingkan kepalanya dan melihat Huang Rong sedang berdiri sambil tersenyum, dengan tongkat bambu 
di tangan. Ia merasa sangat ketakutan dan sekaligus marah, telapak tangan kirinya menyerang ke arah bahu Huang Rong,
tangan kanannya beusaha untuk merebut tongkat itu. Huang Rong melangkah ke samping untuk menghindari tangan kirinya,
tetapi tidak menggerakkan tongkat bambunya, ia membiarkan Liang Ziweng memegang tongkat itu. Liang Ziweng senang,
ia mempererat pegangannya, ia berpikir seandainya bocah itu tidak mau melepaskan tongkatnya, maka ia akan merampasnya 
dengan paksa. Segera setelah ia menarik, ia memang berhasil merebut tongkat itu, tapi di luar dugaannya ujung tongkat itu 
bergetar dan meluncur lepas dari tangannya. Saat itu ujung tongkat telah memasuki daerah pertahanannya. Tangannya begitu 
dekat dengan tongkat itu, karena itu ia buru-buru menangkapnya kembali, tapi ia terlambat. Bayangan hijau tua melesat 
dan 'plak!' kepalanya terpukul telak oleh tongkat bambu itu.

Secara keseluruhan kungfunya tidak lemah, dan pada saat kritis itu ia masih sanggup melemparkan diri ke tanah dan 
bergulingan lebih dari satu _zhang_ sebelum akhirnya bangkit berdiri. Ia menatap kaget ke arah gadis kecil dengan 
mata jernih dan gigi seperti gading itu. Bagian atas kepalanya terasa sakit, pikirannya kacau, mukanya tampak tidak 
keruan.

Huang Rong berkata sambil tertawa, "Kau tahu apa nama ilmu tongkat ini? Kau sudah kena gebukanku, itu membuatmu 
jadi _apa_?"

Liang Ziweng sudah pernah sengsara gara-gara Tongkat Penggebuk Anjing itu sebelumnya, ia dipukuli setengah mati
oleh Hong Qigong. Kejadian itu sudah beberapa tahun yang lalu, tetapi ia masih menyimpan ketakutan dalam hatinya.
Ia melihat bahwa teknik tongkat itu memang adalah Ilmu Tongkat Penggebuk Anjing milik Hong Qigong, dipakai untuk 
melawannya. Kelihatannya anak perempuan ini sungguh-sungguh ahli waris Hong Qigong. Dengan sudut matanya ia melihat 
Sha Tongtian dan Peng Lianhu terus-terusan mundur di bawah tekanan telapak tangan Guo Jing tanpa bisa balas menyerang.
Ia berteriak, "Untuk menghormati Hong Lao Bangzhu, ayo kita mundur!" Ia memanggil kedua muridnya dan berbalik untuk 
pergi.

Siku kiri Guo Jing bergerak melingkar memaksa Sha Tongtian mundur tiga langkah, diikuti oleh sapuan tangan kirinya.
Peng Lianhu melihat bahwa telapak tangan itu membawa serta hembusan angin kuat, ia tidak berani menghadapinya secara 
terang-terangan, ia buru-buru melangkah ke samping untuk mengelak. Tangan kanan Guo Jing mengait, mencekal 
punggungnya dan mengangkatnya ke atas.

Peng Lianhu agak pendek, diangkat setinggi itu di udara kakinya menendang-nendang dengan panik. Ia berusaha membebaskan 
dirinya, siap untuk memukul dada Guo Jing seperti palu menghantam paku, tetapi bagaimana ia bisa meneruskan pukulan 
itu? Ia cepat-cepat berseru, "Ini hari apa?"

"Apa?" tanya Guo Jing bingung.

"Masa kau tidak ingin memelihara nasib baikmu? Kau tidak ingin menepati janji?" tanya Peng Lianhu.

"Apa?" tanya Guo Jing lagi, tangan kanannya masih mencekal Peng Lianhu di udara.

"Kita punya kesepakatan untuk bertarung dalam kontes di Jiaxing pada tanggal lima belas bulan delapan," kata Peng Lianhu.
"Ini bukan Jiaxing, dan sekarang juga bukan Perayaan Pertengahan Musim Gugur. Masa kau mau mencelakai aku?"

Guo Jing berpikir bahwa ia benar, ia hendak melepaskan Peng Lianhu ketika tiba-tiba teringat sesuatu. "Apa yang kau 
lakukan terhadap saudaraku Zhou Botong?"

Peng Lianhu menjawab, "Lao Wantong itu taruhan melawan biksu Tibet, siapa yang bergerak lebih dulu akan kalah. Apa 
hubungannya dengan aku?"

Guo Jing melirik kedua orang yang sedang duduk berhadapan di atas tanah, ia merasa lega. "Jadi begitu rupanya,"
pikirnya. Lalu ia berseru, "Da Shifu, kau baik-baik saja?" Ke Zhen'E mengeluarkan suara 'Hm' dari dalam gua.

Guo Jing kuatir segera setelah ia melepaskan Peng Lianhu, kakinya akan langsung menendang ke dadanya, karena itu ia 
melemparkan Peng Lianhu beberapa kaki dari situ dengan tangan kanan sambil berteriak, "Pergi sana!"

Peng Lianhu mengambil kesempatan itu untuk bersalto dan mendarat di tanah. Ia melihat Sha Tongtian dan Liang Ziweng 
sudah melarikan diri. Ia mengomel dalam hati atas ketidaksetiaan mereka. Ia merangkapkan tangannya kepada Guo Jing 
sambil berkata, "Tujuh hari lagi di Jiaxing kita akan bertarung untuk menentukan siapa yang lebih unggul." Ia berbalik 
dan memamerkan Qinggong-nya untuk melarikan diri. Ia sedang berpikir-pikir tentang satu hal, "Setiap kali aku ketemu 
bocah tengik ini, kungfunya selalu melompat maju sangat jauh. Kenapa seaneh ini? Mungkinkah dia minum ramuan ajaib 
atau menemukan salah satu rahasia ilahi?"

Huang Rong mendatangi Zhou Botong dan Lingzhi Shangren, ia memperhatikan bahwa mereka berdua saling menatap tanpa 
mengedipkan mata. Melihat situasi itu ia teringat pembicaraan antara kedua pejalan kaki dan tahu bahwa ini pasti 
ulah Peng Lianhu yang sangat jahat. Mereka pasti takut menghadapi kungfu Zhou Botong, karena itu mereka mengakalinya 
supaya taruhan dengan biksu Tibet itu untuk tetap diam tak bergerak. Kungfu Lingzhi Shangren jauh sekali jika 
dibandingkan dengan Zhou Botong, tetapi kalau bisa membuatnya diam tak bergerak, maka yang lainnya akan punya 
kesempatan untuk menghadapi Ke Zhen'E.

Lao Wantong akan senang sekali kalau ada orang yang menemaninya bermain-main, ia tidak akan peduli tentang hal lain,
jadi tidak ada gunanya mencoba berunding dengan dia. Meskipun ada pertarugan dahsyat yang mengguncang dunia di dekatnya,
ia pasti akan tetap diam tak bergerak seperti Gunung Taishan, bahkan ia tak akan menggerakkan jari kelingkingnyam ia
sudah bertekad untuk memenangkan taruhan dengan Lingzhi Shangren.

"Lao Wantong! Aku di sini!" panggil Huang Rong.

Zhou Botong mendengarnya, tapi ia takut kalah taruhan, jadi ia tidak menanggapi.

Huang Rong berkata, "Taruhan pakai cara ini, kalaupun kalian duduk sampai berjam-jam tetap saja tidak ketahuan 
siapa yang menang atau kalah, ini sih tidak asyik! Begini saja, aku akan menggelitik kalian berdua di titik 
Xiao Yao Xue[^xiao-yaou-xue] dengan kedua tanganku. Aku akan membuat kedua tanganku berisi tenaga dalam jumlah
yang sama. Siapa yang tertawa lebih dulu berarti kalah."

[^xiao-yao-xue]: Titik akupuntur Xiao Yao Xue paling sensitif di tubuh manusia, kalau terkena totokan maka orangnya akan merasa sangat geli dan tertawa terbahak-bahak.

Zhou Botong sudah lama duduk diam dengan tidak sabar, ketika mendengar ucapan Huang Rong ia setuju dengan sepenuh 
hatinya, tetapi ia tidak berani menunjukkan persetujuannya. Huang Rong tidak mengatakan apa-apa lagi, ia mengambil 
posisi di antara mereka berdua dan duduk di situ. Ia menaruh Tongkat Penggebuk Anjing di atas tanah dan mengulurkan 
kedua tangannya, kedua jari telunjuknya menotok Xiao Yao Xue di tubuh kedua orang itu. Ia tahu tenaga dalam Zhou 
Botong jauh sekali melampaui Lingzhi Shangren, jadi ia bukan berlaku tidak adil, ia engerahkan sejumlah tenaga yang 
sama untuk menotok keduanya. Tetapi di luar dugaan, sementara Zhou Botong memang tidak bergerak sesuai perkiraannya,
teryata Lingzhi Shangren juga tampaknya tidak merasakan apa-apa.

Huang Rong diam-diam mengaguminya, ia berpikir, "Cara biksu ini menutup titik akupunturnya sendiri bagus sekali. Kalau
aku yang ditotok seperti ini pasti aku akan langsung tertawa sampai bergulingan." Lalu ia mengerahkan lebih banyak tenaga 
di kedua tangannya.

Zhou Botong menggunakan tenaga dalamnya, berusaha keras melawan kekuatan jari Huang Rong, tetapi titik akupuntur 
Xiao Yao Xue itu erletak di dekat tulang iganya, otot-otot yang menutupinya sangat lunak, sangat sulit mengirimkan 
tenaga dalam ke daerah itu. Kalau ia meluruskan punggungnya maka ia akan bisa meminjam momentum dari gerakan itu untuk
mengerahkan tenaga, tapi itu akan membuatnya bergerak dan kalah taruhan. Ia merasa tenaga jari Huang Rong makin lama 
makin kuat, ia tak punya pilihan selain melawan jari itu dengan putus asa.

Sedetik kemudian ia tak tahan lagi, otot-otot di sekitar tulang iganya berkontraksi dan menyingkirkan jari Huang Rong.
Ia melompat dan tertawa nyaring, sambil berkata, "Biksu gendut, kau hebat! Lao Wantong mengaku kalah!"

Melihatnya mengaku kalah, Huang Rong menyesal. "Kalau aku tahu akan jadi begini, aku pasti akan memakai lebih banyak 
tenaga ke tubuh biksu gendut itu," pikirnya. Lalu ia berdiri dan berkata kepada Lingzhi Shangren, "Kau menang. 
Nenekmu[^nenek-1] tidak mau mengambil nyawamu. Ayo sana pergi! Pergi!"

[^nenek-1]: Gu Bo (姑婆), sebutan untuk seorang bibi dari ayah seseorang. Tingkatnya setara dengan kakek atau nenek, tetapi tidak ada sebutan yang setara dalam bahasa Indonesia. Kalau kita memakai istilah 'Bibi Nenek' akan sangat tidak lucu dan tidak masuk akal.

Sangat menarik, ternyata Lingzhi Shangren seperti tidak mendengar ucapannya, ia masih tetap duduk diam tak bergerak.
Huang Rong mengulurkan tangan dan mendorong bahunya, sambil berteriak nyaring, "Siapa yang ingin melihat tampang tololmu
di sini? Kau mau mati?" Ia hanya mendorong pelan, tapi yang mengejutkannya adalah Lingzhi Shangren terjungkal ke tanah,
tetap dalam posisi duduk bersila, seperti ukiran kayu Buddha.

Zhou Botong, Guo Jing dan Huang Rong terpana. Huang Rong berpikir, "Apa mungkin caranya menutup titik akupuntur masih 
belum sempurna dan ia tewas karena melakukan itu?" Ia mengulurkan tangan untuk merasakan pernafasannya dan menemukan 
bahwa Lingzhi Shangren masih bernafas. Dengan segera ia mengerti apa yang terjadi, ia marah tapi sekaligus juga geli.
Kepada Zhou Botong ia berkata, "Lao Wantong, kau jatuh ke perangkap orang tanpa tahu apa-apa. Kau betul-betul tolol!"

Zhou Botong terbelalak. "Apa?" Ia sangat marah.

Huang Rong berkata sambil tersenyum, "Coba kau buka dulu totokannya, baru kita bicara lagi."


Zhou Botong rolled his eyes then he stooped down and traced Lingzhi Shangren’s body.
He tapped several places and found out that eight of Lingzhi Shangren’s major acu-
points were sealed by someone else. He jumped up in anger and shouted, “That did not
count! That did not count!”

“What did not count?” Huang Rong asked.

Zhou Botong replied, “His friends sealed up his acupoints after he was seated, of course
this fat monk could not move. Even if we sit for three more days and nights he won’t
lose.” Turning toward Lingzhi Shangren lying on the ground, he called out, “Come, we’ll
compete again.”

Seeing Zhou Botong was exuberant, he was not by any means injured, Guo Jing was
worried about his Shifu. He no longer listened to Zhou Botong talking nonsense, he
sneaked into the cave to see Ke Zhen’Ewithout saying anything.

Zhou Botong stooped down to unseal Lingzhi Shangren’s acupoints while talking non-
stop, “Come, we’ll compete again, we’ll compete again!”

Huang Rong coldly said, “What about my Shifu? Where did you throw him?”

Zhou Botong was taken aback. “Aiyo!” he cried and turned around, rushing toward the
cave. He moved so abruptly that he almost collided with Guo Jing at the cave entrance.
Guo Jing was holding Ke Zhen’E’s hand, leading him out of the cave. He saw his Shifu
was wearing plain white cloth and white headband; Guo Jing was startled, “Shifu!” he
asked, “Have any of your family members died? Where are Er Shifu [Second Master]
and the others?”

Ke Zhen’E raised his head to the sky without saying anything, two lines of tears flowed
down on his cheeks. Guo Jing was shocked, but did not dare to ask. Then he saw Zhou
Botong was helping someone else going out of the cave. That person’s left hand was
holding a wine gourd, his right hand holding half a chicken, his mouth busily nibble on
the chicken leg, a broad smile on his face, and he kept nodding his head. He was none
other than the Nine-fingered Divine Beggar Hong Qigong.

Jing and Rong two people were overjoyed, “Shifu!” they called out together.

Ke Zhen’E’s face suddenly appeared very angry; he lifted up the iron staff and fiercely
hit the back of Huang Rong’s head. The staff movement was swift and fierce, it was a
lethal strike from the ‘fu mo zhang fa’ [demon subduing staff technique], which he had
painstakingly trained to perfection in the Mongolian desert, with the intention to use it
against the blinded Mei Chaofeng. It was created so that even though Mei Chaofeng
could hear the staff’s wind, she would not be able to evade it.

Huang Rong had just seen Hong Qigong after a long time and was squealing with de-
light; she had never guarded against any sneak attack from her back. By the time she
was feeling the wind, the blast of the iron staff had already enveloped her completely.
Guo Jing saw the staff was about to shatter her skull, in his desperation his left hand
swept horizontally shoving the staff aside; while his right hand stretched out and
grabbed the head of the staff. In panic he had used too much power, without realizing
that by this time his strength had increased tremendously. The move of his left palm
was from the Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms.

Ke Zhen’E felt a sudden surge of strong energy. He was unable to block and the iron
staff fell down from his hand, he himself also tumbling down to the ground. Guo Jing
was startled; hastily he stooped down to pick him up. “Da Shifu! [First Master]” he
called out. Guo Jing saw Ke Zhen’e’s nose was swollen and two of his teeth were broken.

Ke Zhen’E spat the teeth, along with some blood, into his palm. “For you!” he said in a
cold voice.

Guo Jing was dumbstruck. He knelt down and said, “Disciple deserves to die. Shifu,
please punish me severely.”

Ke Zhen’E was still holding out his hand, saying, “For you!”

Guo Jing wept. “Da Shifu ...” He chocked, not knowing what to say or do.

Zhou Botong laughed and said, “I’ve seen master beating his disciple, but I’ve never
seen disciple beating his master until today. Amusing! Truly amusing!”

Hearing this Ke Zhen’E was more furious. “Fine,” he said, “There is a saying: swallow
the knocked down tooth and the blood. Shall I do it for you?” Holding out his hand he
tossed the teeth into his mouth, throwing his head backward he swallowed the teeth
into his belly. Zhou Botong clapped his hands, burst out in laughter and cheered loudly.

Huang Rong noticed the situation was unusual. The grievous expression on Ke Zhen’E’s
face had not disappeared. It was unclear why he wanted to kill her; her heart was full
of questions. Slowly she went to Hong Qigong and pulled his hand.

Guo Jing knocked his head to the ground and said, “Even if I have to die ten thousands
times, disciple will never dare to offend Da Shifu. I was out of my mind to let my hand
slip and struck Da Shifu.”

Ke Zhen’E said, “Shifu this and Shifu that, who is your Shifu? You have the Master of
the Peach Blossom Island as your father-in-law, why would you need a Shifu? The
Seven Freaks of Jiangnan do not have the ability, how can we be worthy to be Guo
Daye’s [big master Guo] Shifu?”

Guo Jing heard his words were getting sharper and sharper; he kept knocking his head
to the ground.

Finally Hong Qigong could not bear it much longer; he interrupted by saying, “Ke Daxia
[Great Hero Ke], Master and disciple spar with each other, somebody losing control is a
common occurrence. The stance Jing’er used just now was taught by me. Just blame it
on the Old Beggar. Please accept my apology.” And he did indeed cup his fists in respect.

Listening to Hong Qigong, Zhou Botong thought, “Why don’t I say something too?”
Thereupon he said, “Ke Daxia, Master and disciple spar with each other, somebody los-
ing control is a common occurrence. The technique Brother Guo Jing used to grab your
iron staff just now was taught by me. Just blame it on the Old Urchin. Please accept my
apology.” And he also cupped his fists in respect.

He was just talking nonsense and meant it as a joke, but Ke Zhen’E was livid. He be-
lieved Zhou Botong intentionally insulted him, and as a result he also regarded Hong
Qigong’s good intention as a bad one. With a loud voice he said, “You, Eastern Heretic,
Western Poison, Southern Emperor and Northern Beggar, always think that your mar-
tial art skills are matchless and you can turn this world upside-down? Humph! I say
many of your deeds are not righteous, certainly nothing good comes out of you.”

With a surprised voice Zhou Botong asked, “Hey, what did the Southern Emperor do to
you that you include him in your curse?”

Huang Rong was listening quietly on the side; she knew the more they talked, the
worse the situation had become. The Old Urchin being there would only make it more
difficult to make Ke Zhen’E’s fury subsided. She opened her mouth and said, “Old
Urchin, ‘the weaving of mandarin ducks desiring to fly together right away’ is looking
for you; aren’t you going to see her?”

Zhou Botong was startled; he jumped three feet into the air and shouted, “What?!?”

Huang Rong said, “She wants to ‘stand face to face taking a bath wearing red clothes
when the green spring grass ripples in the deepest of dawn’s cold’ with you.”

Zhou Botong was even more shocked. “Where? Where?” he shouted.

Huang Rong pointed to the south and said, “Over there! Go see her, quick!”

Zhou Botong said, “I won’t see her. Good Miss, I will do whatever you tell me to do; just
don’t ever tell her that you have seen me ...” Before he even finished talking, his feet
moved and he ran to the north.

“I’ll hold on to your promise!” Huang Rong called out.

From a distant came Zhou Botong’s reply, “Once the Old Urchin make a promise, I won’t
regret it.” As the words ‘regret it’ came out of his mouth, like a flash of lightning his
shadow had already disappeared.

Huang Rong’s original intention was for him to see Ying Gu. Who would have thought
that Zhou Botong avoided Ying Gu like a serpent or a scorpion and ran away from her
in fear. It totally blew her mind away; nevertheless she succeeded in getting rid of him.

Up to this time Guo Jing was still kneeling in front of Ke Zhen’E. With tears in his eyes,
he said, “For disciple’s sake Seven Shifus had traveled to a faraway desert. Even if
disciple’s body is ground to dust and my bones are shattered, it will still be difficult for
me to repay Seven Shifus’ kindness. This palm of mine had offended Da Shifu, disciple
does not want it anymore!” Drawing the dagger from his waist Guo Jing chopped it
down on his left wrist.

Ke Zhen’E swung his iron staff horizontally, striking the dagger to the side. Although
the dagger was light and the iron staff heavy, when the two weapons collided sparks
flew up; Ke Zhen’E felt a tingling sensation on his palms. He knew Guo Jing was using
his entire strength, thus showing his sincerity.

“Fine,” he said, “If that’s the case, then you must do what I say.”

Guo Jing was very happy. “Whatever Da Shifu says, disciple will not dare to disobey,” he
said.

“If you don’t do what I say, I forbid you to see my face in the future and thus our mas-
ter-disciple relationship is severed,” Ke Zhen’E said.

Guo Jing said, “Disciple will do my best. If I can’t do it, I’d rather die.”

Ke Zhen’E struck his iron staff heavily on the ground and shouted, “Go and cut the Old
Heretic Huang’s and his daughter’s heads; then you can comeback to see me.”

To say Guo Jing was shocked was an understatement. “Da ... Shi ... Shifu ...” he stam-
mered with a trembling voice.

“What?” Ke Zhen’E asked.

“I wonder how did Huang Daozhu [Island Master Huang] offend you?” Guo Jing asked.

Ke Zhen’E heaved two heavy sighs. Suddenly he gritted his teeth and said, “I really wish
the Heaven would restore my sight if only for a moment so I can see your face; you, an
ungrateful little animal!” Lifting his iron staff high he hacked it down toward the top of
Guo Jing’s head.

As Ke Zhen’E asked Guo Jing to do something for him, Huang Rong had already had a
vague guess. When Ke Zhen’E’s iron staff suddenly struck and Guo Jing did not evade,
she thought whatever happened, saving Guo Jing’s life was more important; hence
from the side her bamboo stick intercepted the iron staff before it reached Guo Jing’s
head with the ‘e gou lan lu’ [cutting off a vicious dog’s path] stance. As it hit the iron
staff, the bamboo stick shook and coiled around the staff, pushing it slanting sideways.
This Dog Beating Stick Technique was truly marvelous; although her strength was infe-
rior, by borrowing the staff’s strength she managed to re-orient its path.

Ke Zhen’E staggered; without waiting for his feet to come to a complete stop he fiercely
beat his own chest twice and then ran away to the north. Guo Jing ran after him while
calling out, “Da Shifu, wait!”

Ke Zhen’E halted his steps and turned around; with a stern voice he said, “Guo Daye
wants to take my old life?” His expression looked mean and ferocious. Guo Jing was
taken aback; he did not dare to continue. Hanging his head down he heard the sound of
the iron staff against the ground getting farther and farther away, before completely
faded away. Remembering his Shifu’s kindness he could not help but go down on his
knees and wept bitterly.

Taking Huang Rong’s hand Hong Qigong walked to his side. He said, “Ke Daxia and the
Old Heretic Huang both have a very strange temperament; they are always in some
kind of disagreement with each other. Don’t worry, leave it to the Old Beggar to be the
mediator between them.”

Guo Jing wiped his tears and stood up. “Shifu,” he said, “Do you know ... do you know
what it was about?”

Hong Qigong shook his head. “The Old Urchin fell into their trick and was betting
against them in staying still. Those traitors wanted to harm me. Luckily we met your Da
Shifu outside the Ox Village by accident, and he protected me by taking me hiding in
this cave. Thanks to the fierceness of his ‘du ling’ secret projectiles those traitors did not
dare to rush in, so we could hold our ground this long. Ay, your Da Shifu has a noble
heart, he was very brave in battle defending justice. He accompanied me in that cave
resisting the enemy. Undoubtedly he was determined to fight to the death.”

Speaking to this point he took two mouthfuls of wine, and then took a bite on the
chicken leg. Biting and chewing the chicken went into his belly; and then he wiped his
greasy mouth with his sleeve. Only then did he continued speaking, “The battle was
fierce; my martial art skill is gone. I could not offer any help in fighting the enemy. I
only saw your Da Shifu’s face, but did not have the luxury of talking to him about any-
thing. Judging from how he was very angry, I don’t think it was because of your slip of
hand. He is a chivalrous hero, how can he have such a narrow mind? Luckily in just a
few more days it will be the Mid-autumn Festival of the eight month. Wait till the mar-
tial art contest at the Misty Rain Tavern is over, the Old Beggar will speak on your be-
half.” Swallowing his tears Guo Jing uttered his gratitude.

Hong Qigong laughed and said, “Your two babies’ martial art skills have advanced
tremendously. Ke Daxia can be considered a prominent character in the Wulin world,
yet as soon as you two babies made your moves he fell into awkward positions. What is
the story behind it?”

In his heart Guo Jing was ashamed; he did not know what to say. Laughing and giggling
Huang Rong told Hong Qigong everything they went through after they were separated.

Hong Qigong cheered loudly when he heard that Yang Kang killed Ouyang Ke; he shot
curse words when he heard the Beggar Clan’s Elders were swindled by Yang Kang,
“Little Bastard! Four old muddle-headed! Lu Youjiao has feet does not have brain!” He
was entranced when he listened to how Yideng Dashi [Reverend Yideng – great master
Yideng] saved Huang Rong’s life; and how Ying Gu came at midnight to seek vengeance.
Finally his expression slightly changed when he heard Ying Gu suddenly went insane at
the ‘qing long tan’ [green dragon shore]. “Ah!” he exclaimed.

“Shifu, what is it?” Huang Rong asked, “Do you also know Ying Gu?” While in her heart
she mused, “All his life Shifu has never had a wife. Could it be that he was also mesmer-
ized by Ying Gu? Hmm, what’s so good about this Ying Gu anyway? Mystifying, acting
like a mad woman, but can captivate the attention of so many experts of the Wulin
world?” Luckily Hong Qigong’s answer was pleasing to her ears.

“Nothing,” Hong Qigong said, “I don’t know Ying Gu, but when Emperor Duan left home
[meaning: become a monk], I was there by his side. That day he sent a letter to the
north, inviting me to go to the south. I knew he wouldn’t send for the Old Beggar if he
did not have a very important matter. I also remembered Yunnan’s ham, the ‘over the
bridge’ rice-flour noodle, and the chunk of cakes and delicacies; so I left at once. When I
saw him, his face was haggard, like he was suffering from a serious illness; it was com-
pletely different from when I saw him during the Sword Meet of Mount Hua, where he
looked alive with a dragon or a tiger’s appearance. I felt very strange. After I have been
there for a few days with the pretense of discussing martial art he wanted to teach me
the ‘xian tian gong’ [inborn/innate strength/energy] and ‘yi yang zhi’ [solitary yang fin-
ger]. The Old Beggar thought: in the past his Solitary Yang Finger was in a level ground
with my Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms, the Old Poison’s Toad Stance, the Old
Heretic Huang’s ‘pi kong zhang’ [splitting the air palm] and Divine Flicking Finger;
nowadays he had mastered Wang Chongyang’s ‘xian tian gong’. In the second Sword
Meet of Mount Hua the title of Number One Martial Artist in the World would certainly
belong to him; why would he want to pass on these two special skills to the Old Beggar,
without any reason whatsoever? If he wanted to exchange knowledge, why wasn’t he
willing to learn my Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms? There must be something behind
this.

Later on the Old Beggar mulled over this matter, I talked to him and his four main dis-
ciples; finally I found a clue. It turned out that after he passed on these two skills to me
he was going to commit suicide. Only why he was grieving so much, even his own disci-
ples were unclear.”

Huang Rong said, “Shifu, Emperor Duan was afraid that after he died nobody will be
able to control Ouyang Feng anymore.”

“That’s right,” Hong Qigong said, “When I found out, I was adamant of not willing to
learn anything from him. At last he told me the truth; he said that although his four dis-
ciples were loyal and diligent, their minds have been occupied by the kingdom’s affairs
for a long time, that they could not concentrate on training martial art, hence it would
be difficult for them to achieve success. It seemed like the Quanzhen Seven Masters’
martial art also could not reach the pinnacle of perfection. He said it was fine for me
not willing to learn the Solitary Yang Finger, but if the ‘xian tian gong’ is lost, he would
not have any face to meet Wang Chongyang Zhenren [lit. true/real person, a respectful
term to address a Taoist priest] in the underworld. I asked him to reconsider his deci-
sion, but my persuasion was useless. Only, I was unyielding in my stand not to learn
from him, with the hope of saving his life. Emperor Duan could not change my mind; fi-
nally he relented by abdicating his throne and becoming a monk. I was by his side the
day they shaved his head. It has been more than ten years ago. Ay, finally this enmity
can be resolved, this is very good.”

“Shifu,” Huang Rong said, “We have finished telling our story, what about you?”

“About me?” Hong Qigong asked, “Hmm, at the imperial kitchen I ate four dishes of
‘yuan yang wu zhen kuai’ [minced five-treasure mandarin duck]; it was enough to sati-
ate my craving; and then I ate litchi fruit and kidney, quail soup, sheep tongue in thick
sauce, snail in ginger and vinegar sauce, oyster fermented in sheep’s tripe ...” on and on
he listed the name of the dishes he ate at the imperial kitchen, while constantly swal-
lowing his own saliva and licking his own lips.

“Why is it that later on the Old Urchin could not find you?” Huang Rong interrupted.

Hong Qigong smiled, “The imperial kitchen chefs repeatedly found their prepared
dishes vanished into thin air; they thought there was a fox fairy making disturbance in
that place, so they burned incense and lighted candles to worship me. Later on they
told the chief of the imperial palace guards, who then dispatched eight palace guards to
the imperial kitchen to catch the fox. The Old Beggar thought it was a serious situation;
and neither the Old Urchin nor his shadow could be seen. I had no choice but slipped
away to a remote part to hide for a while. That place was called ‘e lu hua tang’ [green
calyx flower hall] or something, it was full of plum flower trees. From the look of it, it
was the winter quarter where that fellow, the Emperor, spends his days enjoying the
plum blossoms. Only it was the middle of summer; except several old eunuchs sweep-
ing the ground everyday early in the morning, not even a ghost’s shadow came to that
place. The Old Beggar was free to roam around. Everywhere in the imperial palace
there were things to eat; even a hundred beggars won’t die of starvation in that place,
thereupon I was able to heal my injury in peace and quiet.

I stayed there for more than ten days. One day in the middle of the night I suddenly
heard the Old Urchin’s voice pretending to be a ghost; and then the voice turned into
dog’s howling and cat’s meowing. He was turning the palace upside down with the
noise. And then I heard some people call out, ‘Hong Qigong, Hong laoyezi [old master
Hong], Hong Qigong, Hong laoyezi!’ I took a peek. Turned out they were Peng Lianhu,
Sha Tongtian, Liang Ziweng and the other crafty fellows.”

“Ah!” Huang Rong exclaimed in surprise, “Why did they look for you?”

“I thought it was very strange too,” Hong Qigong said, “As soon as I saw them I went
back into hiding. Who would have thought that the Old Urchin had already spotted me.
He was ecstatic; he dashed forward and hugged me, saying, ‘Thank the heaven and
thank the earth for letting me find you at last.’ Immediately he ordered Liang Ziweng
and the others to follow behind us ...”

“How could Liang Ziweng and the others listen to the Old Urchin’s order?” Huang Rong
wondered.

Hong Qigong laughed and said, “At that time I was also racking my brain but could not
figure out the reason. All I can say was that they were very afraid of the Old Urchin.
Whatever he said, they did not dare to disobey. He ordered Liang Ziweng and the oth-
ers to follow behind us, while he carried me to the Ox Village to find you two people.
Along the way he told me that he had looked for me everywhere but could not find me,
he was very worried. And then quite by accident he bumped into Liang Ziweng and the
others by the city wall. In his frustration he beat each and every one of them really bad,
and then ordered them to comb all streets and alleys the whole day and the whole
night to look for me. He said they had been searching around the imperial palace for a
while, but the palace was huge while I was hiding in a remote place. All throughout,
they did not see me.”

Huang Rong said with a smile, “I did not expect the Old Urchin to be that smart, able to
make those devil heads to follow his orders obediently. I wonder why they did not run
away.”

Hong Qigong smiled and said, “The Old Urchin employed a mischievous trick. He
rubbed some dirt from his body and made more than a dozen pills. He forced them to
take three pills for each person, said that this poison would react in seven by seven,
forty nine days. The poison was so lethal and nobody in the world other than himself
would be able to neutralize it. If they were obedient, he would give them the antidote
on the forty-eighth day. Although these wicked thieves half believed and half doubted,

they certainly could not take a risk with their own lives; in the end they did not have
any choice but to believe and they were compelled to listen to the Old Urchin’s yelling
and screaming, without daring to defy.”

Initially Guo Jing was grieving, but hearing Hong Qigong’s story he could not help but
smile. Hong Qigong continued, “When we arrived at the Ox Village we could not find
you two. The Old Urchin again forced them to go out and search for you. Last night they
all came back with their heads hung low. The Old Urchin scolded and cursed them. He
was getting angrier and angrier until suddenly he said, ‘If by tomorrow you still cannot
find those two babies Guo Jing and Huang Rong, I will make urine pulp pills and give
them to you!’ Of course they began to get suspicious and repeatedly provoked him to
talk. The Old Urchin was screaming and kicking, finally they found out that the pills
they took earlier were not poison at all. I know the situation would turn dangerous;
these traitors would certainly create not a small trouble. I told the Old Urchin to kill
them all. Who would have thought that Peng Lianhu also saw the danger, immediately
he hatched a deception; he told that fat Tibetan monk to compete against the Old
Urchin in sitting still in meditation. I could not stop them, and was forced to run out of
the Ox Village. I came across Ke Daxia outside the village. He protected me and we ran
to this place. Peng Lianhu and the others chased us. Although the Old Urchin was mud-
dle-headed, he knew better than leaving me alone, so he busily overtook us here. These
traitors constantly provoked him, until finally the Old Urchin could not take it anymore
and agreed to bet against the monk.”

Listening to this story Huang Rong was both angry and amused at the same time, she
said, “If we did not meet them by accident, Shifu, your life would be delivered under
the Old Urchin’s hand.”

Hong Qigong said, “My life is almost gone anyway, it doesn’t really matter whose hand
will deliver it away.”

Huang Rong suddenly remembered something. “Shifu,” she said, “That day when we
came back from Ming Xia Dao [bright red clouds island] ...”

“It’s not Ming Xia Dao, it’s ‘ya gui dao’ [crushing ghost island],” Hong Qigong
interrupted.

“Fine,” Huang Rong smiled slightly, “It’s Ya Gui Dao then. Now, that Ouyang Ke is not
the least bit a fake ghost, he is a real ghost. That day when we rescued Ouyang Feng un-
cle and nephew, on the wooden raft the Old Poison said that there was one man in this
whole wide world who can heal your injury. Only this person’s martial art is matchless;
so we can’t use force against him, and you are not willing to harm others to benefit
yourself by asking him to help you. At that time you were not willing to mention this
person’s name. Later on Jing Gege and I went to Xiangxi. Naturally now we know that
other than Emperor Duan then, or Reverend Yideng now, there is no one else.”

Hong Qigong sighed, “If he used Yiyang Zhi [Solitary Yang Finger] to attack my ‘qi jing
ba mai’ [lit. marvelous/mysterious passage 8 pulses, Kwok & Huang Yushi from
Wuxiapedia translated it as: Eight Extraordinary Channels], without a doubt he would
heal my injury. But this kind of skill will injure his own internal strength for as long as
five years or as few as three years, it’s hard to say. Let’s just say that he does not care
about the second Sword Meet of Mount Hua, but he is already over sixty years of age;
just how much longer is he going to live? How can the Old Beggar open his mouth and
ask for his help?”

“Shifu,” Guo Jing said happily, “This is great! We don’t need anybody’s help, I can go
through your ‘qi jing ba mai’.”

Hong Qigong was surprised, “What?” he asked.

Huang Rong said, “Jing Gege recited that babbling and mumbling part from the Manual
and Reverend Yideng has translated it for us. He told us to tell you, Senior, to use this
technique to open your own ‘qi jing ba mai’.” Straightaway she recited Yideng’s transla-
tion from memory.

After listening to this Hong Qigong pondered for a long time, and then he jumped in joy
and exclaimed, “Wonderful! Wonderful! I believe I will need only about one and a half
year to recover.”

Huang Rong said, “In the Misty Rain Tavern martial art contest our opponent will
surely invite Ouyang Feng to help their side. The Old Urchin’s martial art might not be
inferior to his, but he is a wild person. I am afraid he won’t show up during the compe-
tition time. We must go to the Peach Blossom Island to get my father’s help to ensure
victory.”

“What you said is not wrong,” Hong Qigong said, “I will go to Jiaxing first, the two of
you go to the Peach Blossom Island.”

Guo Jing was reluctant to leave his shifu, he insisted on escorting Hong Qigong to
Jiaxing. Hong Qigong said, “I will ride your little red horse. If there is any problem
along the way, the Old Beggar will just run away. Who can chase after me?”

Immediately he mounted the horse. With a couple of ‘glug, glug’ he drank his wine, and
then pressed the horse’s belly with his legs. The little red horse let out a long neigh to-
ward Guo Jing and Huang Rong, as if it did not want to leave them, and then galloped
like the wind to the north.

Guo Jing watched until he could not see Hong Qigong’s shadow anymore, he also re-
called how Ke Zhen’Ewanted to kill Huang Rong, his heart was heavy. Huang Rong did
not try to comfort him. She went alone to find a boat for hire then they set sail toward
the Peach Blossom Island.

When they arrived on the Island, they immediately sent the boat away. Huang Rong
said, “Jing Gege, I am going to ask a favor from you. Will you promise to grant it?”

“What is it?” Guo Jing asked, “I don’t want to do something I won’t be able to do.”

Huang Rong laughed and said, “I am not going to ask you to cut off your six masters’
heads.”

Guo Jing was upset. “Rong’er,” he said, “Can’t you not mention this matter anymore?”

“Why can’t I mention it?” Huang Rong countered, “You may have already forgotten
about it; but I can’t. Even though I am good to you, I don’t want you to cut down my
head.”

Guo Jing sighed and said, “I really don’t understand why Da Shifu was so angry. He
knew you are the love of my life. I’d rather die a thousand times, ten thousand times,
than hurting you the least bit.”

Huang Rong could hear the sincerity in his voice, her heart was moved. She pulled his
hand and leaned against his body. Pointing to a row of willow trees by the creek she
said with a tender voice, “Jing Gege, do you think this Peach Blossom Island is
beautiful?”

“It truly looks like a fairyland,” Guo Jing replied.

Huang Rong sighed, “I want to live here forever, I don’t want to be killed by you,” she
said.

Guo Jing gently stroked her hair and said, “Good Rong’er, how can I kill you?”

Huang Rong said, “What if your six masters, your Mama, your good friend, they all ask
you to kill me? Will you do it or not?”

Guo Jing confidently said, “Even though everybody in the world wants to make things
difficult for you, I will always protect you.”

Huang Rong held his hand tightly and asked, “Will you be willing to leave all these peo-
ple for me?”

Guo Jing hesitated and did not answer. Huang Rong looked up and gazed at his eyes,
with anxious expression on her face, waiting for his answer.

Guo Jing finally said, “Rong’er, I said that I would accompany you on the Peach Blossom
Island for the rest of my life. I have made that decision before I opened my mouth.”

“Good!” Huang Rong said, “Then from this day on, you are not going to leave this
island.”

Guo Jing was taken aback, “From this day on?”

“Um, yes,” Huang Rong said, “From this day on! I am going to ask Father to go to Misty
Rain Tavern and fight for us. Father and I will go to kill Wanyan Honglie to avenge your
father. Father and I will go to Mongolia to fetch your Mama. I will even ask Father not
to blame your six masters. I am going to take care of every single one of your concerns
for you.”

Guo Jing saw the expression on her face was a little bit unusual; he said, “Rong’er, what
I said to you, you can definitely count on it. Don’t you worry; you don’t have to do all
these things.”

Huang Rong sighed, “The matters in this world are difficult to say,” she said, “When you
agreed to marry that Mongolian Princess, did you ever think that someday you’ll regret
your own decision? Previously I only knew that whatever I wanted, I got it. But now I
know ... Ay! Whatever you wish you have, just pray that the Heaven will not make
things difficult for you.” Speaking to this point she could not restrain her eyes from
turning red. She hung her head low.

Guo Jing was silent; his heart was filled with tumultuous thoughts. He realized how
much Huang Rong loved him, and it made him wanting to stay on the Island to be with
her forever. But he felt it was inappropriate for him to ignore all his concerns; only
why it was inappropriate, he did not know.

Huang Rong softly said, “It’s not that I don’t believe you or want to force you to live
here; it’s just that I am really scared.” Speaking of this she suddenly threw herself into
his arms and sobbed on his shoulder.

Guo Jing was caught by surprise; he was at a loss of what to do. He quickly said,
“Rong’er, what are you afraid of?” Huang Rong did not reply, but she started to weep.

Ever since Guo Jing knew her, they had been through many difficult and dangerous,
sometimes miserable situations, but he had always seen her smiling and laughing. This
time she was back in her home and very soon will see her father; why was she scared
all of a sudden? He asked, “Are you afraid your father has met some accident?”

Huang Rong shook her head. Guo Jing asked again, “Are you afraid once I leave this is-
land I won’t be coming back?” Again Huang Rong shook her head. Guo Jing successively
asked four, five questions but she shook her head again and again.

After a while Huang Rong lifted her head up and said, “Jing Gege, I don’t know what I
am afraid of. I remember your Da Shifu’s expression when he told you to kill me, I just
can’t shake it off my mind. I always feel there will come a day you are going to listen to
him and kill me. That was the reason I asked you not to leave this place. Will you prom-
ise me?”

Guo Jing smiled and said, “I was wondering what important matter worries you so
much; turns out it is only over this. That day in Beijing didn’t my Six Shifus cursed you
as little female demon [xiao yao nu, yao – goblin/witch/devil/monster] or something like
that? Afterwards I ran away with you, but we don’t have any problem until today. My
Six Shifus seem strict and mean, but their hearts are kind and loving. Once you get to
know each other I am sure they will certainly like you. Er Shifu’s [Second Shifu] skill in
picking other people’s pocket is amazing; you can learn from him. I am sure you’ll have
a lot of fun. Qi Shifu [Seventh Shifu] is tender and friendly ...”

Huang Rong cut him off, “So you are determined to leave this place?” she asked.

Guo Jing replied, “The two of us will leave together; we’ll both go to Mongolia to fetch
my Mother, we’ll kill Wanyan Honglie together, and then together we will come back to
this place. Won’t that be great?”

With a startled look on her face Huang Rong said, “If that’s the case, I am afraid we
won’t be coming back together forever, we won’t be together for rest of our lives.”

“Why?” Guo Jing wondered.

Huang Rong shook her head and said, “I don’t know. But when I saw your Da Shifu’s ex-
pression that was what I felt. It seemed like killing me is not enough; his hatred went
deep into his bones and marrow.”

As Guo Jing listened to her, he could see that her heart was broken. Although her face
still showed that childlike naïveté, her eyebrows and the corner of her eyes clearly
showed her feelings towards the upcoming disaster. He recalled that she was always
right; if this time he did not listen to what she said and some day a disaster befell her,
how would that be good? Thinking about this his heart ached; he was overwhelmed
with emotion and blurted out, “All right! I am not going to leave this place, ever!”

Hearing him Huang Rong fixed her gaze to his face for half a day without saying any-
thing; two streams of tears slowly flowed down her cheeks. Guo Jing said in low voice,
“Rong’er, what else do you want?”

“What else do I want?” Huang Rong said, “I want nothing else!” She raised her beautiful
eyebrows up. “Even if I want something else, the Heaven won’t let me.” Her long sleeve
gently rose up, she danced underneath the flower trees. As she turned her head
around, the golden band on her hair glittered under the sun. Her clothes fluttered in
the breeze. She danced faster and faster; every now and then she held out her hand to
shake down the trees and petals of flowers fell down like rain: red flower, white flower,
yellow flower, purple flower, they fluttered in the air just like butterflies dancing
around her, creating a very beautiful scenery.

She danced for a moment, suddenly leaped up a tree, and then leaped over to another
tree, dancing from tree to tree performing the ‘yan shuang fei’ [the fly of a pair of swal-
lows] and ‘luo ying shen jian zhang’ [falling (leaves) divine sword palm technique]
stances. She looked so happy.

Guo Jing thought, “Mama often told me stories about a fairy mountain on the eastern
sea, where many fairies lived. I wonder if there is a fairy mountain more beautiful than
the Peach Blossom Island, and if there is a fairy more beautiful than Rong’er?”
