# Memanah Burung Rajawali

Contains Indonesian translation of Jin Yong novel, Divine Eagle Shooting Heroes (She Diao Ying Xiong Zhuan, 射鵰英雄傳)

I am trying to translate this novel into Indonesian based on the English version, which actually is _fan translated_,
so in order to get the real meaning of certain Chinese terminology, you are advised to read the original novel,
which in turn was published by Hong Kong Commercial Daily from 1957, January 1 - 1959, May 19.

Because I am _not_ quite familiar with Chinese writings, then I can only translate the story from the English version.

To view the novel outside of GitHub, we may need some _simple_, and yet effective HTML and JavaScript, which is included
here. I do not use fancy codes to transform the **Markdown** text, just enough to give us convenient and nice text,
with all references videos (if any), and also some screenshots I get from dramas here and there.

I hope you enjoy the story.
